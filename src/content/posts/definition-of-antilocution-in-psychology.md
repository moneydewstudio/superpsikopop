## What is the definition of antilocution according to Psychologists?

antilocution is Encouraging social prejudice by using verbal communication in a particularly negative way (e.g. by using emotively loaded words and metaphors).

Encouraging social prejudice means when someone tries to make other people dislike or judge others based on their differences. They do this by using mean words, saying things that make people feel strong emotions, and making comparisons that are not fair or kind. It's like saying hurtful things to make people think that certain groups of people are bad or less than others.
