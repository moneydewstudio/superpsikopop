## What is the definition of barbiturate according to Psychologists?

barbiturate is A widely used drug, generally given to promote sleep or to control epilepsy. Barbiturates are highly addictive and commonly abused, producing amnesiac disorders in long-term users.

Barbiturates are medicines that are often prescribed to help people sleep better or to control seizures caused by epilepsy. However, it's important to know that these drugs can be highly addictive and often misused by some people. When someone becomes addicted to barbiturates, it means they have a strong urge to keep taking them even when they don't need them anymore. This can cause serious problems in the long run. People who use barbiturates for a long time may experience memory loss and problems with remembering things. So, it's crucial to use these drugs only as prescribed by a doctor and to be aware of their potential risks.
