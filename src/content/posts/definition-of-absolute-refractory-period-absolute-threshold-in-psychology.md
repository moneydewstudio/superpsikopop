> The period of a few milliseconds immediately after the firing of a neurone. During the absolute refractory period, the neurone will not produce another electrical impulse, no matter how much stimulation it may receive. See also relative refractory period. The minimum amount of stimulation required for an event to be detected. The absolute threshold of a particular form of stimulus is set at the point where 50 per cent of the signals with that physical value are detected.

## What is the definition of absolute refractory period absolute threshold according to Psychologists?

absolute refractory period absolute threshold is The period of a few milliseconds immediately after the firing of a neurone. During the absolute refractory period, the neurone will not produce another electrical impulse, no matter how much stimulation it may receive. See also relative refractory period. The minimum amount of stimulation required for an event to be detected. The absolute threshold of a particular form of stimulus is set at the point where 50 per cent of the signals with that physical value are detected.

After a neurone fires, there is a short time period where it cannot fire again, no matter how much it gets stimulated. This is called the absolute refractory period. It's like when you eat a big meal and you are so full that you can't eat anymore, no matter how delicious the food is.

The absolute threshold is the minimum amount of stimulation needed for us to notice or detect something. For example, if you are sitting in a quiet room and someone whispers, you might not hear it because the sound is too soft. But if they speak a bit louder, you will hear it. So the absolute threshold is like the amount of sound that needs to reach your ears for you to notice it. It's like the minimum sound level that your ears can pick up.

 

## What are the example case of absolute refractory period absolute threshold?

1\. Absolute Refractory Period: - Hodgkin and Huxley (1952): In their groundbreaking research, Hodgkin and Huxley conducted experiments on the giant axon of a squid and discovered the existence of the absolute refractory period. They observed that during this period, it is impossible to trigger another action potential, regardless of the strength of the stimulus. This research laid the foundation for understanding the mechanisms underlying the refractory period in neurons.

\- Attwell and Laughlin (2001): In their research study, Attwell and Laughlin explored the functional significance of the absolute refractory period in visual neurons. They investigated how the refractory period affects the processing of visual information and the responsiveness of neurons. They concluded that the refractory period plays a crucial role in preventing long-lasting excitation and ensuring the temporal precision of neural coding.

2\. Absolute Threshold: - Fechner (1860): Gustav Fechner is often credited as the founder of psychophysics, the study of the relationship between physical stimuli and perception. In his research, Fechner developed a method to determine the absolute threshold, which is the minimum intensity at which a stimulus becomes perceivable. Fechner's pioneering work laid the groundwork for further investigations into perceptual thresholds.

\- Stevens (1957): Stevens introduced the concept of Stevens' Power Law, which describes the relationship between the perceived magnitude of a stimulus and its physical intensity. He conducted rigorous psychophysical experiments to determine the absolute threshold for various sensory modalities, including vision, hearing, and touch. Stevens' work contributed significantly to our understanding of how sensory systems detect and discriminate between different stimuli.

These studies are considered influential in their respective fields and have significantly contributed to our understanding of the absolute refractory period and absolute thresholds in neural and sensory perception.
