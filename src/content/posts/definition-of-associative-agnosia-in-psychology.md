## What is the definition of associative agnosia according to Psychologists?

associative agnosia is A failure to recognise objects, thought to be due to an impairment in memory for those objects, and possibly linked to impairment of information transmission in the ventral visual stream.

Sometimes people have trouble recognizing objects because they have trouble remembering what those objects look like. This might happen because there is a problem with how their brain sends information about the objects to their eyes.

 

## What are the example case of associative agnosia?

This research discusses associative agnosia as a condition where patients have difficulty recognizing objects despite normal visual perception. The study explores various case studies and presents insights into the underlying neural mechanisms associated with associative agnosia.

2\. Sergent, J., & Signoret, J. L. (1992). Varieties of functional deficits in prosopagnosia. Cerebral Cortex, 2(6), 375-388.

This study investigates the link between prosopagnosia (a specific form of associative agnosia affecting face recognition) and other visual processing impairments. The research highlights the varied manifestations of associative agnosia and emphasizes the importance of understanding the distinct functional deficits associated with this condition.

3\. Riddoch, M. J., & Humphreys, G. W. (1987). BORBBrunel Object Recognition Battery. Thames Valley Test Co.

The Brunel Object Recognition Battery (BORB) is a well-known tool used to assess different aspects of object recognition, including associative agnosia. The battery comprises a range of tests designed to explore the diverse deficits associated with associative agnosia, providing valuable insights into the disorder.

This study proposes a theory suggesting that associative agnosia may be a result of a default strategy employed by the brain to prioritize general intelligence over domain-specific visual recognition abilities. It explores the relationship between associative agnosia and general intelligence and provides evidence to support this hypothesis.

This research investigates the neural network involved in face processing and its relevance to associative agnosia. The study highlights the role of specific regions, including the right middle fusiform gyrus, and emphasizes the importance of intact connectivity within this network for normal face recognition abilities, shedding light on associative agnosia's underlying mechanisms.

 

## What are other terms related to associative agnosia?

1\. Object agnosia: refers to a specific form of agnosia in which individuals have difficulty recognizing or identifying familiar objects, even when they can perceive the individual features or components of the object accurately.

2\. Apperceptive agnosia: a type of agnosia characterized by a failure to perceive or make sense of objects due to a deficit in visual processing or perception. Individuals with apperceptive agnosia may struggle with object recognition and have difficulty distinguishing between different shapes or objects.

3\. Prosopagnosia: a specific type of associative agnosia that refers to the inability to recognize familiar faces. Individuals with prosopagnosia may have difficulty identifying or remembering faces, even those of close friends or family members.

4\. Simultanagnosia: a type of agnosia characterized by the inability to perceive or process more than one object or visual stimulus at a time. Individuals with simultanagnosia may struggle to understand complex scenes or identify multiple objects within a visual field, despite having intact perception of individual objects.

5\. Spatial agnosia: a form of agnosia in which individuals have difficulty perceiving or understanding spatial relationships between objects or have impaired spatial navigation skills. This can lead to challenges in tasks such as finding objects in a cluttered environment or navigating through space.

6\. Alexia without agraphia: a specific type of associative agnosia characterized by the inability to read or comprehend written words, while still maintaining the ability to write or recognize individual letters. Individuals with alexia without agraphia may struggle with reading, but their other language skills remain intact.

7\. Central achromatopsia: a form of agnosia characterized by the inability to perceive colors or color-related information. Individuals with central achromatopsia may see the world in shades of gray and have difficulty identifying or distinguishing between different colors.
