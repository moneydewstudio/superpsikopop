Self-actualization: Self-actualization is a concept developed by humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow, which refers to the process of realizing and fulfilling one's potential, and striving for personal growth and fulfillment. It involves feeling content, satisfied, and fulfilled with oneself and one's circumstances.

Cognitive dissonance: Cognitive dissonance is a psychological term coined by Leon Festinger, referring to the mental discomfort or tension that occurs when an individual holds contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, or when one's actions contradict their beliefs. It often leads to a motivational drive to reduce the dissonance and seek consistency.

Social influence: Social influence is the process by which individuals, groups, or society as a whole affect the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of others. It includes various forms of influence such as conformity (changing one's behavior to fit the norms of a group), obedience (complying with authority figures), and persuasion (attempting to change someone's attitudes or behavior through communication).

It involves bouncing back from difficult life events and developing effective coping strategies to maintain mental well-being. Resilience helps individuals to thrive, grow, and maintain a positive outlook even in the face of challenges.
