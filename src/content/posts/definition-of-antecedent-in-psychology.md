## What is the definition of antecedent according to Psychologists?

antecedent is Taking place before a relevant event. An antecedent may be the cause of the event, but it cannot be assumed that it was. See also causality.

An antecedent is something that happens before something else that we think is important. It may have caused the important thing to happen, but we can't say for sure. We also need to know about causality, which is the idea of cause and effect, or how one thing can make something else happen.
