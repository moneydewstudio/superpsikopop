## What is the definition of articulatory suppression according to Psychologists?

articulatory suppression is A term used in connection with the working memory model, and referring to the suppression or blocking of the activity of the articulatory loop. This is usually achieved by asking the participant to undertake some other cognitive task instead, such as counting backwards in threes.

In the working memory model, there's something called "articulatory loop." It's like a little voice in our head that helps us remember things by silently repeating them. But sometimes, we want to stop that voice from talking so we can focus on something else.

To do that, we can give our mind another task to do, like counting backward in threes. This keeps our little voice busy with the counting task and stops it from repeating the information we're trying to forget.

 

## What are the example case of articulatory suppression?

1\. Baddeley, A.D., Thomson, N., & Buchanan, M. (1975). Word length and the structure of short-term memory. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 14(6), 575-589.

This study by Baddeley et al. investigates the effects of articulatory suppression on short-term memory. They find that participants cannot maintain as many words in their memory when they are simultaneously engaged in articulatory suppression tasks, indicating that articulatory suppression affects verbal rehearsal processes.

2\. Fayol, M., Barrouillet, P., & Marinthe-Cano, G. (1998). The time course of response inhibition in a visual field paradigm. Brain and Cognition, 37(3), 369-390.

In this study, Fayol et al. examine the effects of articulatory suppression on response inhibition in a visual field paradigm. They discover that participants who engaged in articulatory suppression showed slower response inhibition compared to those who did not, suggesting that articulatory suppression impairs response inhibition processes.

3\. Macken, W.J., & Fleming, P. (1990). The effect of articulatory suppression and irrelevant speech on short-term memory for order. British Journal of Psychology, 81(2), 167-180.

Macken and Fleming investigate how articulatory suppression impacts short-term memory for order. They find that participants who perform articulatory suppression tasks show poorer performance in recalling the correct order of items, suggesting that articulatory suppression interferes with the encoding and retrieval of sequential information.

4\. Salame, P., & Baddeley, A.D. (1986). Disruption of short-term memory by unattended speech: Implications for the structure of working memory. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 25(6), 657-674.

This study by Salame and Baddeley explores the disruptive effects of unattended speech on short-term memory. They determine that unattended speech can interfere with verbal rehearsal processes, leading to impaired memory performance. Articulatory suppression is discussed as an effective method to minimize the impact of unattended speech on working memory.

5\. Watkins, M.J., & Watkins, O.C. (1975). Buildup of proactive inhibition as a cue-overload effect. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 1(4), 442-452.

Watkins and Watkins investigate the buildup of proactive inhibition using articulatory suppression as a cue-overload effect. They propose that when participants engage in articulatory suppression tasks, it prevents them from processing and encoding new information effectively, leading to proactive interference and impaired recall performance.

Note: The mentioned studies are selected examples of notable research relating to articulatory suppression, and there may be numerous other relevant and insightful studies on this topic.

 

## What are other terms related to articulatory suppression?

1\. Motor interference: Refers to the disruption or interference caused by engaging in a motor task while simultaneously performing a cognitive task, such as articulatory suppression. 2. Verbal interference: Involves interference caused by engaging in a verbal or speech task while simultaneously performing a cognitive task, similar to the effect of articulatory suppression. 3. Subvocalization: The internal speech that accompanies reading (or thinking) and involves the movement of vocal muscles without actual vocalization. Subvocalization is similar to articulatory suppression as it involves the suppression of speech-related movements. 4. Auditory suppression: The act of deliberately suppressing or blocking out auditory stimuli or sounds. Although not directly related to articulatory suppression, it shares similarities in terms of attempting to suppress or limit the input to a particular sensory channel. 5. Dual-task interference: Refers to the interference or decrement in performance that occurs when an individual simultaneously performs two tasks, such as articulatory suppression and a cognitive task, simultaneously. The interference can be due to limitations in attention or limited processing capacity.
