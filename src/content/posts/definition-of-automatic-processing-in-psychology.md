## What is the definition of automatic processing according to Psychologists?

automatic processing is The cognitive processing of information without conscious awareness or intention.

It's like our brain can do things without us even realizing it. When we learn and think about stuff, we do it on purpose and we're aware of it. But sometimes our brains can do what they need to do without us even thinking about it. It's like our brain has a secret superpower!

 

## What are the example case of automatic processing?

1\. Automatic Processing of Visual Information: This research study explored how the human brain automatically processes visual information without conscious effort. It revealed that certain features, such as color and motion, are processed automatically, while others require deliberate attention.

2\. Automaticity in Language Processing: This research examined how language processing becomes automatic over time. It investigated how skilled readers can effortlessly and rapidly recognize words and comprehend sentences without conscious awareness of the underlying processes.

3\. Automatic Emotional Processing: This study investigated how emotions are automatically processed in the human brain. It explored the automatic evaluation of emotional stimuli and the impact of emotional processing on memory and decision-making.

4\. The Neuroscience of Automatic Decision-Making: This research explored the neural mechanisms underlying automatic decision-making. It aimed to understand how the brain automatically evaluates options and makes choices without conscious effort, focusing on areas such as the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia.

5\. Automaticity in Skill Acquisition: This research investigated how skills become automatic with practice. It examined the process of automatization, where initially conscious and effortful actions become automatic and require less conscious attention and control.

6\. Automatic Processing and Stereotyping: This study explored how automatic processing contributes to the formation and activation of stereotypes. It examined how stereotypes can be activated automatically and influence social judgments and behaviors without conscious deliberation.

7\. Automatic Processing in Memory Retrieval: This research focused on how memory retrieval can occur automatically and unconsciously. It investigated how cues from the environment can trigger automatic retrieval of relevant information, even when individuals are not consciously thinking about it.

8\. Automatic Attentional Capture: This study explored how attention can be automatically captured by salient or emotionally arousing stimuli. It investigated the automatic processes involved in attentional selection, highlighting the role of automaticity in capturing attention.

9\. Automatic Processing and Misattribution of Memory: This research examined how automatic processing can lead to memory errors and misattributions. It explored how automatic associations and implicit biases can influence memory retrieval and distort accurate recollection of past events.

10\. The Neural Basis of Automatic Processing: This study focused on identifying the neural mechanisms underlying automatic processing. It used various neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to investigate the brain regions and networks involved in automatic information processing.
