## What is the definition of Antons syndrome according to Psychologists?

Antons syndrome is The mistaking of visual imagery as visual perception, which occurs in some blind people.

Sometimes, people who can't see can still experience pictures in their minds. It's like they have a movie playing in their head, even though they can't actually watch it with their eyes. But sometimes, these people might think that the pictures in their mind are actually real and happening in the world around them. They can't tell the difference between what they imagine in their head and what they see with their eyes.



## What are the example case of Antons syndrome?

1\. Pössl J, et al. (1989) Anton's syndrome: visual anosognosia due to damage to the right occipital and superior temporal gyrus. Neuro-ophthalmology. 9(1):5-13. This research discusses a case study of a patient with Anton's syndrome, a condition characterized by visual anosognosia (lack of awareness of visual deficits) due to damage to specific brain regions.

2\. Landis T, et al. (1990) Anton's syndrome from bilateral posterior cerebral artery occlusion  an eye movement study. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry. 53(9):856-858. This study investigates the eye movements in patients with Anton's Syndrome caused by bilateral posterior cerebral artery occlusion, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of this condition.

3\. Silverberg N, et al. (1992) "Blindsight" in patients with Anton syndrome. Neurology. 42(8):1629-1632. This research looks at patients with Anton's Syndrome who exhibit "blindsight"  the ability to unconsciously detect visual stimuli despite being consciously blind  and explores the neurological basis for this phenomenon.

4\. Voss P, et al. (2006) Blindsight Taught Me How to See: A case study of a bilaterally cortically blind patient. Consciousness and Cognition. 15(2):397-418. This case study focuses on a patient with Anton's Syndrome who demonstrates blindsight and how they learn to navigate the world using unconscious visual processing, shedding light on the potential neural mechanisms underlying this ability.

5\. Carrozzo M, et al. (2020) Painful Anton's Syndrome: a rare presentation of stroke. The Journal of Emergency Medicine. 58(4):557-559. This research highlights a case of Anton's Syndrome with additional unusual symptomatology, including pain, and emphasizes the importance of considering atypical presentations of the syndrome in the clinical setting.



## What are other terms related to Antons syndrome?

1\. Cortical blindness: A condition where there is damage to the occipital cortex of the brain, resulting in partial or total loss of vision, despite the eyes being able to function normally. Anton's syndrome is a type of cortical blindness. 2. Visual anosognosia: A lack of awareness or denial of visual loss or impairment, commonly seen in Anton's syndrome. Patients with this condition may be completely unaware that they are blind.

3\. Anton-Babinski syndrome: Another name for Anton's syndrome, named after Gabriel Anton and Jules Babinski, the doctors who first described the condition.

4\. Agnosia: A condition characterized by the inability to recognize or interpret sensory information, such as objects, faces, or sounds. Visual agnosia is often associated with Anton's syndrome, as patients cannot recognize or perceive visual stimuli despite having intact vision.

5\. Hemianopia: A form of visual impairment where half of the visual field in one or both eyes is lost. In Anton's syndrome, patients may have hemianopia but are unaware of their visual loss due to their brain's inability to process visual information.

6\. Neurological damage: Refers to any injury or dysfunction within the nervous system, particularly the brain, that can lead to Anton's syndrome. This damage can be caused by stroke, traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or other conditions affecting the occipital cortex.

7\. Confabulation: In the context of Anton's syndrome, confabulation refers to the creation of false or fabricated explanations to fill in gaps in memory or awareness. Patients may make up stories or explanations to account for their visual loss, as they are unaware that they are blind.

8\. Visual field defect: An abnormality or loss of vision within a specific area of the visual field. Anton's syndrome is characterized by a denial or unawareness of visual field defects, leading to confabulation or visual anosognosia.
