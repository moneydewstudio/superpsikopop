> A term used to describe a cognitive model in which the brain is seen as combining separate pieces of information about an event in order to make the best judgement about the nature of that event. This was a popular model in the early days of artificial intelligence research, but its summative approach has not been supported by neurological evidence, and in AI it has been largely replaced by parallel distributed processing.

## What is the definition of analysis-by-synthesis according to Psychologists?

analysis-by-synthesis is A term used to describe a cognitive model in which the brain is seen as combining separate pieces of information about an event in order to make the best judgement about the nature of that event. This was a popular model in the early days of artificial intelligence research, but its summative approach has not been supported by neurological evidence, and in AI it has been largely replaced by parallel distributed processing.

Imagine that your brain is like a really smart computer. This cognitive model is a way to understand how your brain takes in different pieces of information about something that happens and uses all of that information to figure out what is going on.

In the past, scientists thought that the brain would take each piece of information and put them all together to make a final decision about what was happening. They called this the summative approach. It was a really popular idea when they were studying how to make computers think like humans.

But as they learned more about how our brains actually work, they didn't find strong evidence to support this idea. Instead, they found that our brains actually work more like lots of little parts working together all at the same time. They call this parallel distributed processing.

So, the idea of the brain combining separate pieces of information has become less popular in artificial intelligence research, and scientists now focus more on how all the different parts of our brain work together to process information.

## What are other terms related to analysis-by-synthesis?

Analysis-by-synthesis is a concept in cognitive psychology that explains how individuals construct mental models or representations of the world by combining analysis and synthesis. Analysis refers to the process of breaking down complex information into smaller components, while synthesis involves integrating these components to form a coherent understanding. This approach allows individuals to make sense of the world by analyzing and then combining various pieces of information.

Functionalism

Functionalism is a psychological theory that focuses on how mental processes and behaviors enable individuals to adapt and achieve their goals in different environments. This perspective emphasizes the practical functions of mental processes rather than their underlying structures. It examines how mental states and behaviors help individuals fulfill specific functions and adapt to their surroundings.

Stereotype threat

Stereotype threat refers to the phenomenon in which individuals, particularly those belonging to marginalized groups, experience anxiety and underperformance in situations where they believe their actions or abilities might confirm negative stereotypes about their group. This psychological process highlights the impact that societal stereotypes can have on individuals' self-perception and performance.

Confirmation bias

Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when individuals interpret or seek out information in a way that confirms their pre-existing beliefs or expectations. It leads people to selectively process information, focusing on evidence that aligns with their existing views while ignoring or downplaying contradictory evidence. This bias can hinder objective analysis and lead to distorted perceptions of reality.

Psychoanalysis

Psychoanalysis is a therapeutic approach developed by Sigmund Freud that aims to explore and resolve unconscious conflicts and repressed emotions. This approach focuses on uncovering unconscious thoughts, desires, and memories that may contribute to psychological distress or dysfunctional behaviors. Psychoanalysis employs various techniques, such as dream analysis and free association, to bring these unconscious processes into conscious awareness.

Classical conditioning

Classical conditioning is a type of learning that explains how associations between stimuli can influence our behavior. It was first studied by Ivan Pavlov, who famously conducted experiments with dogs to demonstrate this process. Classical conditioning involves pairing a neutral stimulus (such as a bell) with a naturally occurring stimulus (such as food) to evoke a response (salivation) that was originally only triggered by the naturally occurring stimulus. This process helps explain how individuals can develop certain behaviors or responses through associative learning.
