## What is the definition of achievement test according to Psychologists?

achievement test is A test designed to measure what a person has already achieved (e.g. a statistics examination). See also aptitude test, psychometric test.

A achievement test is like a tool that helps teachers and others see how well you have done in a particular subject or skill. For example, let's say you take a statistics test in school. This test is designed to see how much you have learned and understood about statistics. It measures what you have achieved so far in that subject. It is different from a test that measures your potential or ability to learn something new.

 

## What are the example case of achievement test?

One of the most notable research papers related to achievement tests is "Validity and Utility of Alternate Assessments Based on Modified Achievement Standards" by Martha L. Thurlow, published in 2001. This study looked at the validity and utility of alternate achievement tests for students with disabilities. The research found that these alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards were useful in understanding the academic progress of students with disabilities and in making informed decisions about their educational needs.

Another important research paper related to achievement tests is "The Assessment of Achievement Motivation in Children: Current Research and Contemporary Issues" by Andrew J. Elliot and Judith M. Harackiewicz, published in 1996. This study explored the conceptualization, measurement, and implications of achievement motivation in children, highlighting the importance of understanding motivational aspects that influence students' test performance and academic outcomes.

Additionally, "A Meta-Analysis of the Predictive Validity of the ACT Assessment for First-Year College Course Performance" by Allen J. Trumbo, published in 1999, is a significant research paper in the field of achievement testing. This study examined the predictive validity of ACT scores for college course performance, showing a strong relationship between ACT scores and subsequent academic success in college, highlighting the importance of standardized achievement tests in college admissions.

These research papers provide valuable insights into the validity, utility, and predictive power of achievement tests, contributing to our understanding of their importance and impact in education.

 

## What are other terms related to achievement test?

Standardized Test: An achievement test that is administered and scored in a consistent manner to ensure fairness and comparability among test-takers.

Norm-Referenced Test: A type of standardized test that compares an individual's performance to the performance of a group of individuals, known as the norming group.

Criterion-Referenced Test: An achievement test designed to measure an individual's performance against a predetermined set of criteria or standards rather than in comparison to the performance of others.

Educational Assessment: The process of gathering and evaluating information about a student's academic performance and abilities.

Formative Assessment: Ongoing assessments conducted during the learning process to provide feedback and guide instructional decisions.

Summative Assessment: Assessments conducted at the end of a learning period to evaluate a person's overall understanding and mastery of the material.

Multiple-Choice Test: An assessment format where individuals choose the correct answer from a list of options.

Performance-Based Assessment: An evaluation that requires individuals to demonstrate their skills and knowledge through practical tasks or projects.

Validity: The extent to which an achievement test measures what it intends to measure.
