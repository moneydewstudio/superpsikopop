> An area of the brain in between the frontal lobes and the limbic system, which has been classified as belonging to either brain structure at various times. It is involved in evaluating risks and assessing the value of proposed responses, such as working out whether an action is likely to be rewarded or punished. It is also involved in processing bodily signals which characterise emotions, particularly disgust, and it is active in detecting errors and monitoring complex responses, such as those required for the Stroop test. See also cingulate cortex.

## What is the definition of anterior cingulate gyrus according to Psychologists?

anterior cingulate gyrus is An area of the brain in between the frontal lobes and the limbic system, which has been classified as belonging to either brain structure at various times. It is involved in evaluating risks and assessing the value of proposed responses, such as working out whether an action is likely to be rewarded or punished. It is also involved in processing bodily signals which characterise emotions, particularly disgust, and it is active in detecting errors and monitoring complex responses, such as those required for the Stroop test. See also cingulate cortex.

The brain has different parts, kind of like different sections of a house. One of these parts is in the middle of the front area and the emotional area of the brain. Scientists sometimes disagree on which part it belongs to, but they call it the "cingulate gyrus."

This part of the brain helps us figure out if something is a good idea or not. It helps us decide if we should do something based on whether we will get rewarded or punished. It also helps us understand our emotions, especially when we feel disgusted. It also helps us notice when we make mistakes and when we need to pay attention to something important. It's like a brain helper that does a lot of different jobs.

 

## What are the example case of anterior cingulate gyrus?

Neuron, 76(4), 838-846. doi: 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.09.029 This study investigates the role of the anterior cingulate cortex, including its medial and lateral subdivisions, in encoding and maintaining task rules in macaque monkeys. The authors provide evidence for synchronous oscillatory neural ensembles in the termanterior cingulate gyrus which support rule representation and maintenance.

Psychological Review, 109(4), 679-709. doi: 10.1037/0033-295X.109.4.679 This research focuses on the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying error processing and behavioral adaptation. It highlights the involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex, including the termanterior cingulate gyrus, in error-related processing and the modulation of behavior based on error signals.

Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 12(3), 154-167. doi: 10.1038/nrn2994 This comprehensive review explores the integration of negative affect, pain perception, and cognitive control processes in the cingulate cortex, including the termanterior cingulate gyrus. It provides insights into the functional role of this brain region in modulating emotional responses and pain experience.

Neuron, 50(5), 799-812. doi: 10.1016/j.neuron.2006.04.031 Using functional MRI data, this study identifies a core network involved in the implementation of task sets, including the termanterior cingulate gyrus. The findings suggest that this region plays a crucial role in task switching and cognitive control processes.

Emotion, 6(1), 40-61. doi: 10.1037/1528-3542.6.1.40 This research investigates the impact of anxiety on visuospatial working memory and its neural correlates. The authors highlight the involvement of the termanterior cingulate gyrus in mediating the disruptive effects of anxiety on cognitive processes, specifically working memory.

 

## What are other terms related to anterior cingulate gyrus?

1\. Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC): It is the part of the brain that lies in the frontal lobe, which includes the anterior cingulate gyrus. It is involved in various cognitive functions, including attention, emotion regulation, decision-making, and conflict monitoring.

2\. Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC): It is a subregion of the anterior cingulate cortex that primarily contributes to the regulation of cognitive control, such as attentional allocation, conflict monitoring, and decision-making.

3\. Ventral Anterior Cingulate Cortex (vACC): Another subregion of the anterior cingulate cortex that plays a crucial role in emotional processing, such as affect regulation, empathy, reward processing, and decision-making.

4\. Anterior Cingulate Gyrus: It is a structure within the frontal lobe that is part of the limbic system and contains the anterior cingulate cortex. It is associated with various cognitive and emotional processes, such as attention, emotion regulation, social cognition, and pain perception.

5\. Cingulate Cortex: It refers to the entire region of the brain that encompasses both the anterior cingulate cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. It is involved in various functions, including emotion, attention, memory, and executive control.
