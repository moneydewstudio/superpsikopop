## What is the definition of anchoring according to Psychologists?

anchoring is In social representation theory, the process of making the social representation easier to grasp by setting it in a familiar context. In decision-making theory, anchoring refers to the process of establishing a set reference point or framework, from which an option is evaluated.

In social representation theory, it means taking something complicated and making it simpler by comparing it to something familiar.

In decision-making theory, anchoring means having a starting point or frame of reference to evaluate different choices. It's like using a ruler to measure the length of something - you need a starting point to compare the other lengths to.

 

## What are the example case of anchoring?

One of the most notable and influential research studies on anchoring is the seminal work conducted by Tversky and Kahneman in 1974. They presented participants with a wheel-of-fortune-style game that was rigged to land on either 10% or 65% of the numbers on the wheel, thus providing an anchor for the participants. They found that participants' estimates of the percentage of African countries in the United Nations exceeded the anchor when they were exposed to the 10% anchor, and fell short of the anchor when exposed to the 65% anchor. This study demonstrated the powerful influence of anchoring on subsequent judgments.

Another influential study on anchoring was conducted by Ariely et al. in 2003. Participants were asked to write down the last two digits of their social security number and then estimate the price of various items, such as wine or computer equipment. The study found that participants with higher last two digits of their social security number provided significantly higher price estimates compared to those with lower last two digits. This study suggested that even arbitrary anchors, such as the last two digits of a social security number, can bias people's judgments.

Furthermore, Strack and Mussweiler conducted research on selective accessibility and anchoring in 1997. Their study demonstrated that anchoring effects can be influenced by the availability and accessibility of relevant information. Participants were shown a list of various instances of a social behavior, and then asked to estimate the percentage of people who engaged in that behavior. They found that participants' estimates were influenced by the specific examples they were exposed to, and these primed examples acted as anchors for their subsequent judgments.

These studies, among others, have contributed to our understanding of anchoring biases and how they can shape our judgments and decision-making processes. They highlight the significance of anchoring as a cognitive bias and have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms behind this phenomenon.

 

## What are other terms related to anchoring?

Anchoring: A cognitive bias that occurs when individuals rely too heavily on an initial piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions or judgments, even if the anchor is irrelevant or unreliable.

Cognitive dissonance: A state of psychological discomfort that occurs when a person holds contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or values, which often motivates individuals to reduce their inconsistency by changing their beliefs or behaviors.

Self-fulfilling prophecy: A belief or expectation about oneself or others that influences behavior in a way that brings about the predicted outcome, often leading to a confirmation of the original belief.

Confirmation bias: The tendency to search for, interpret, and favor information that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses, while ignoring or downplaying contradictory evidence.

Stanford prison experiment: A psychological study conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971 that explored the impact of perceived power and social roles on individuals' behaviors, revealing the potential for abusive and unethical behavior in simulated prison settings.
