## What is the definition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) according to Psychologists?

attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is Those children in which ADD shows itself primarily in the form of a high level of activity.

Some kids who have ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) might show it by being very active. They tend to have lots of energy and can't sit still for long. They might fidget or move around a lot more than other kids.

 

## What are the example case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?

1\. The Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA study): This study, conducted over 14 months, examined different treatment approaches for children with ADHD. It found that medication alone and a combination of medication and behavioral therapy showed the most significant improvements in symptoms and functioning.

2\. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) study on ADHD and brain development: This study used brain imaging techniques to investigate the differences in brain structure and function in individuals with ADHD. It found that certain regions of the brain responsible for attention, impulse control, and motor activity were smaller or functioned differently.

3\. The Methylphenidate Equivalence in Adults with ADHD (META study): This study aimed to determine the optimal dosage of methylphenidate (a commonly used medication for ADHD) for adults. It found that a higher dose produced more significant symptom improvement and higher response rates.

4\. The Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study: This study explored the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development of ADHD. It found that both genetic and environmental factors contributed to the risk of developing ADHD and that genetic factors were also associated with comorbid conditions.

5\. The Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS): This study examined the effectiveness of medication for preschoolers with ADHD. It found that medication (methylphenidate) combined with behavioral therapy improved symptoms and functioning in preschool-aged children with ADHD.

6\. The Preschool ADHD Assessment Scale (PAAS) study: This research focused on developing an assessment scale specifically for preschoolers with ADHD symptoms. It aimed to provide a reliable tool for early identification and intervention in young children.

7\. The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC): This ongoing study investigates ADHD prevalence, associated factors, and long-term outcomes in Australian children. It provides valuable insights into the persistence of ADHD symptoms, medication use, and the impact on academic achievement and quality of life.

8\. The Environmental Exposures and Gene-Environment Interactions in ADHD (IMAGE) study: This study focused on the role of environmental factors, such as prenatal exposures and maternal smoking, in the development of ADHD. It found that prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke was associated with a higher risk of ADHD in children.

These notable studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of ADHD, its causes, effective treatments, and long-term outcomes. They have helped shape guidelines for diagnosis and management of ADHD in both children and adults.

 

## What are other terms related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?

1\. Hyperactivity: a condition characterized by excessive physical restlessness and movement. 2. Inattention: a difficulty in sustaining focus, often resulting in poor attention to details and frequent distractions. 3. Impulsivity: a tendency to act or speak without thinking first, often resulting in impulsive and sometimes risky behavior. 4. Executive function: a set of cognitive processes that enable individuals to plan, organize, initiate, and regulate behavior. 5. ADHD Predominantly Inattentive Type (ADHD-PI): a subtype of ADHD characterized by primarily showing symptoms of inattention, rather than hyperactivity or impulsivity. 6. ADHD Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type (ADHD-PHI): a subtype of ADHD characterized by predominantly showing symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity, rather than inattention. 7. ADHD Combined Type (ADHD-C): the most common subtype of ADHD, characterized by a combination of symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. 8. Neurodevelopmental disorder: a disorder that affects the development and functioning of the brain, including ADHD. 9. Stimulant medications: medications commonly prescribed to treat ADHD that work by increasing levels of certain brain chemicals involved in attention and impulse control. 10. Executive function deficits: difficulties in the cognitive processes involved in planning, problem-solving, organizing, and self-regulation, often associated with ADHD.
