> The concept of autistic spectrum disorders was introduced in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), which groups together a range of developmental disorders, emerging during early childhood and characterised by four sets of symptoms: social and communication difficulties, stereotyped or repetitive behaviours, sensory issues, and cognitive difficulty or delay in cognitive processing. Autistic spectrum disorders may not include all of these, but generally include three out of the four. There are conditions identified as autistic spectrum disorders: autism itelf, Aspergers syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorders, and PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorders not otherwise specified). It is open to question, particularly with respect to the last of these syndromes, whether the classification represents a real problem or a trend to medicalise untypical or unusual forms of childhood behaviour that in previous times were regarded as normal but distinctive or unusual.

autistic spectrum disorders is The concept of autistic spectrum disorders was introduced in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), which groups together a range of developmental disorders, emerging during early childhood and characterised by four sets of symptoms: social and communication difficulties, stereotyped or repetitive behaviours, sensory issues, and cognitive difficulty or delay in cognitive processing.

Autistic spectrum disorders are a group of developmental disorders that some kids have. These disorders have different symptoms, like having trouble with communication and socializing, doing the same actions or movements over and over again, being sensitive to sounds or textures, and having trouble thinking. Autistic spectrum disorders usually have at least three out of these four symptoms. There are a few specific disorders that fall under the category of autistic spectrum disorders, like autism and Asperger's syndrome. Some people argue whether all of these disorders are actually different problems or just a way of labeling kids who behave differently.

 

## What are the example case of autistic spectrum disorders?

1\. Baio, J. (2014). Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder among Children Aged 8 Years  Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2010. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report: Surveillance Summaries, 63(2), 1-21.

This study provides an updated prevalence estimate of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among children aged 8 years in multiple sites across the United States. It highlights the increasing prevalence of ASD and the need for continued research and support for individuals on the autistic spectrum.

2\. Baron-Cohen, S., Leslie, A. M., & Frith, U. (1985). Does the Autistic Child Have a Theory of Mind? Cognition, 21(1), 37-46.

This seminal research paper proposed the concept of a "theory of mind" deficit in individuals with autism. It suggested that individuals on the autistic spectrum struggle with understanding the thoughts and emotions of others, which has been an influential idea in the field of autism research.

3\. Dawson, G., Rogers, S., Munson, J., Smith, M., Winter, J., Greenson, J., ... & Varley, J. (2010). Randomized, controlled trial of an intervention for toddlers with autism: the Early Start Denver Model. Pediatrics, 125(1), e17-e23.

This study examined the effectiveness of the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) intervention for toddlers with ASD. It demonstrated significant improvements in several outcomes, including cognitive abilities and adaptive behavior, highlighting the potential for early intervention in improving outcomes for individuals on the autistic spectrum.

4\. Happé, F. G. (1994). An advanced test of theory of mind: Understanding of story characters' thoughts and feelings by able autistic, mentally handicapped, and normal children and adults. Journal of autism and developmental disorders, 24(2), 129-154.

This research investigated the complex theory of mind abilities in individuals with autism, compared to individuals with intellectual disabilities and neurotypical individuals. It provided evidence for selective impairments in theory of mind in autistic individuals, aiding in understanding the social and communication difficulties associated with ASD.

5\. Lord, C., Risi, S., Lambrecht, L., Cook Jr, E. H., Leventhal, B. L., DiLavore, P. C., ... & Rutter, M. (2000). The Autism Diagnostic Observation ScheduleGeneric: A standard measure of social and communication deficits associated with the spectrum of autism. Journal of autism and developmental disorders, 30(3), 205-223.

This study introduced the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), a widely used observational assessment tool for diagnosing autism spectrum disorders. It has assisted clinicians and researchers in evaluating social and communication deficits associated with ASD across different age groups.

6\. Lovaas, O. I. (1987). Behavioral treatment and normal educational and intellectual functioning in young autistic children. Journal of consulting and clinical psychology, 55(1), 3-9.

This influential study examined the efficacy of early intensive behavioral intervention (often referred to as Applied Behavior Analysis) for young children with autism. It demonstrated significant improvements in language and cognitive functioning, setting the stage for the development of evidence-based interventions for individuals on the autistic spectrum.

7\. Redcay, E., & Courchesne, E. (2005). When is the brain enlarged in autism? A meta-analysis of all brain size reports. Biological psychiatry, 58(1), 1-9.

This meta-analysis synthesized findings from multiple brain imaging studies in individuals with autism and found evidence of increased brain size in early childhood, followed by normalization over time. It contributed to understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of ASD and the developmental trajectory of brain abnormalities in autism.
