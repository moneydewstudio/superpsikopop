## What is the definition of abuse according to Psychologists?

abuse is (i) The use of substances inappropriately in a way that is damaging to the individual (e.g. excessive alcohol consumption, sniffing glue). (ii) Inappropriate and harmful treatment of another person. See also child abuse, domestic abuse.

(i) Substance use is when a person takes things like alcohol or glue in a way that is bad for them. For example, drinking too much alcohol can hurt your body and make you sick. Sniffing glue can also be very harmful and damage your brain. So, it's important to know that using substances the wrong way can be really dangerous and hurt your health.

(ii) Treating someone in a bad way is never okay. When people hurt or do bad things to others, it's called inappropriate or harmful treatment. This can happen in different ways. For instance, child abuse is when grown-ups hurt or mistreat kids, which is not how adults should behave towards children. Domestic abuse is when someone hurts or is mean to someone else in their own family. It's important to remember that treating others with kindness and respect is the right thing to do, and it's never okay to hurt someone else.

 

## What are the example case of abuse?

There is a vast body of research on abuse, as it is a multifaceted topic that encompasses various forms such as physical, emotional, sexual, and psychological abuse. Here are a few notable studies:

1\. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study: Conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Kaiser Permanente, this study is one of the most influential in the field of abuse. It explored the long-term health impacts of childhood abuse and neglect, demonstrating the strong association between adverse childhood experiences and negative health outcomes later in life.

2\. The World Health Organization's Multi-Country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women: This research involved ten countries and highlighted the global prevalence and consequences of violence against women. The study shed light on the alarming rates of intimate partner violence and its devastating effects on women's health and well-being.

3\. National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): This ongoing study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides estimates of sexual violence, stalking, and intimate partner violence in the United States. The survey aims to understand the patterns and impact of various forms of abuse and inform prevention strategies.

4\. The ACE-DV (Adverse Childhood Experiences and Domestic Violence) Longitudinal Study: This research examined the relationship between childhood abuse and later experiences of intimate partner violence. It highlighted how childhood experiences impact the risk of entering abusive relationships and the long-term effects on survivors.

5\. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's (SIPRI) Research on Armed Conflict and Gender-Based Violence: SIPRI's research explores the intersection between armed conflict and gender-based violence. It has contributed to understanding the link between conflict and various forms of abuse, including sexual violence, and how to prevent and respond to such violence during conflicts.

Please note that abuse is a broad topic, and there are numerous other important studies available depending on specific subtopics or types of abuse you are interested in.
