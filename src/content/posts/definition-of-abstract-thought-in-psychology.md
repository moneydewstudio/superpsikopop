## What is the definition of abstract thought according to Psychologists?

abstract thought is Thought that uses concepts which do not have an immediate material correspondence, such as justice or freedom. In Piagets theory of cognitive development, the capacity for abstract thought is only acquired after the age of about 12 years. It is an essential aspect of Piagets formal operational stage

Imagine you are playing a game called "Think Outside the Box." In this game, you learn about something called abstract thought. Abstract thought is like having a superpower that allows you to think about things that you can't see or touch, like ideas or concepts.

You know how you can see and touch things like toys, books, or your pet? That's called concrete thought, and it's what you use when you play with your toys or read a book. But as you get older, your brain gets even smarter and starts to think about things that don't have a material form. It's like using your imagination to understand ideas or feelings.

One example of abstract thought is justice. You know when you are playing with your friends, and one of them takes your toy without asking? You might feel like it's not fair, and that's when you start thinking about justice. Justice is a big word that means being fair and making sure everyone gets treated equally.

Another example of abstract thought is freedom. You know how sometimes you might feel like your teacher or your parents are telling you what to do all the time? Well, when you get older, you start thinking about freedom. Freedom means being able to make choices for yourself and having the opportunity to do what you want as long as it doesn't hurt others.

Now, Piaget, a smart scientist who studied how kids grow and learn, talked about abstract thought too. He said that around the age of 12, kids start using their superpower of abstract thought more often. He called it the formal operational stage. It's like reaching a new level in the game of "Think Outside the Box."

So, abstract thought is like having a superpower to think about ideas or concepts that you can't see or touch, like justice or freedom. It's something that grows in your brain as you get older, and it helps you understand the world in a deeper and more thoughtful way.

 

## What are the example case of abstract thought?

One of the most notable and famous research studies regarding abstract thought is the work of the Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget. Piaget proposed a theory of cognitive development that included a stage called the "formal operational stage," during which individuals develop abstract thinking abilities.

Piaget conducted numerous experiments to study abstract thought in children. One of his famous experiments is the "Three Mountains Task." In this task, children were presented with a model of three mountains and various objects placed on different sides of the mountains. The children were then asked to view the mountain from different angles and determine how the objects would appear from each perspective. Through this experiment, Piaget demonstrated that children at a certain age develop the ability to understand that different perspectives exist, indicating the emergence of abstract thought.

Another influential study on abstract thought is the research conducted by Lawrence Kohlberg on moral development. Kohlberg proposed a cognitive-developmental theory of moral reasoning, which suggests that individuals progress through distinct stages of moral thinking. At the higher stages of moral development, individuals are capable of abstract reasoning and can consider complex moral dilemmas.

Kohlberg's research involved presenting individuals with moral dilemmas and studying their reasoning behind their response. He identified six stages of moral development, ranging from pre-conventional morality (focused on self-interest) to post-conventional morality (based on universal ethical principles). This research helped highlight the role of abstract thinking in moral decision-making.

Furthermore, cognitive psychologists have conducted studies on abstract thinking in adults, particularly in the field of problem-solving and creativity. For example, the research of Gestalt psychologists like Wolfgang Köhler and Max Wertheimer emphasized the role of insight and abstract reasoning in problem-solving. These studies helped shed light on how individuals form novel connections and solutions by thinking abstractly.

In summary, the research conducted by Piaget, Kohlberg, and cognitive psychologists has significantly contributed to our understanding of abstract thought in different domains, including cognitive development, moral reasoning, problem-solving, and creativity. These studies have shaped contemporary theories and models of abstract thinking.
