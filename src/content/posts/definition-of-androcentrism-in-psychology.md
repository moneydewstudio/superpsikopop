## What is the definition of androcentrism according to Psychologists?

androcentrism is The view that male behaviour defines normality and that female behaviour compares unfavourably to this norm.

There is a belief out there that says what boys and men do is considered normal, or what everyone should do. It also says that girls and women do things differently, and people think that those differences are not as good as what boys and men do. Basically, they think that boys' behavior is the "right" way to act, and girls' behavior is seen as not as good or not as important.

 

## What are the example case of androcentrism?

One notable research regarding the term "androcentrism" is a study conducted by Sandra Bem, a prominent psychologist and feminist scholar. Bem's research was instrumental in introducing the concept of androcentrism and providing empirical evidence to support its existence and impact on society.

In her study, published in 1974, titled "The Measurement of Psychological Androgyny," Bem developed the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) to assess individuals' gender role orientation along two dimensions: masculinity and femininity. Through the BSRI, Bem aimed to challenge the traditional binary view of gender roles, which she argued reinforced androcentrism.

Bem's research provided evidence that androcentrism, the cultural bias that privileges men and treats masculinity as superior to femininity, is deeply ingrained in society. Her study revealed that individuals who embrace androgyny, an integration of masculinity and femininity traits, tend to have better psychological adjustment and more flexibility in adapting to various situations compared to individuals who conform strictly to traditional gender roles.

Bem's work challenged the prevailing gender norms and sparked further research on androcentrism, prompting scholars to examine its influence in various fields, including psychology, sociology, and gender studies. Her research laid the foundation for questioning and dismantling traditional gender roles, ultimately contributing to the advancement of gender equality and challenging patriarchal systems.
