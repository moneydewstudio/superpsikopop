## What is the definition of ACTH according to Psychologists?

ACTH is Adrenocorticotrophic hormone.

Adrenocorticotrophic hormone, also known as ACTH, is a special chemical in our bodies that helps control our stress levels. It is made in a part of our brain called the pituitary gland and then travels to our adrenal glands, which are located on top of our kidneys.

ACTH's job is to tell our adrenal glands to produce another hormone called cortisol. Cortisol is a very important hormone that helps our bodies deal with stress by controlling inflammation and regulating our blood sugar levels.

Think of ACTH like a messenger that sends a signal to the adrenal glands, telling them to release cortisol. This helps our bodies respond to different situations, like when we're feeling scared or anxious. So, ACTH and cortisol work together to help us manage stress and keep our bodies functioning properly.

Sometimes, when there is a problem with the production of ACTH or cortisol, it can lead to certain medical conditions. These conditions can affect how our bodies respond to stress and can cause symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and changes in our appetite.

Overall, ACTH is an important hormone that plays a crucial role in our body's response to stress and helps keep us healthy and balanced.

 

## What are the example case of ACTH?

One of the most important and notable research studies regarding ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone) is the discovery and understanding of its role in the body's stress response and the regulation of cortisol production.

1\. The discovery of ACTH: In 1932, Philip Hench and Edward Kendall at the Mayo Clinic successfully purified and isolated ACTH from the pituitary gland. This groundbreaking research laid the foundation for understanding the hormone's role in the body's endocrine system.

2\. HPA axis and stress response: In 1955, Hans Selye proposed the concept of the general adaptation syndrome and the involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress. He demonstrated that ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol, which helps the body cope with stressors.

3\. Cortisol regulation: In 1998, researchers discovered that ACTH release from the pituitary gland is regulated by the hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secreted by the hypothalamus. This complex feedback loop ensures the appropriate secretion of cortisol to maintain homeostasis.

4\. ACTH stimulation test: The ACTH stimulation test, developed in the 1950s and 1960s by researchers such as John M. Slocumb, is a significant diagnostic tool for evaluating adrenal insufficiency or excessive cortisol production. It assesses the adrenal gland's response to exogenous ACTH by measuring cortisol levels.

5\. ACTH deficiency and Cushing's syndrome: Research on ACTH deficiency led to the identification of genetic disorders like adrenal hypoplasia congenita and isolated ACTH deficiency. Conversely, studies on excessive ACTH secretion have advanced the understanding of Cushing's syndrome, a condition characterized by elevated cortisol levels.

These seminal discoveries and ongoing research surrounding ACTH have broadened our understanding of the body's stress response, cortisol regulation, and adrenal disorders, leading to improved diagnosis, treatment, and management of related conditions.
