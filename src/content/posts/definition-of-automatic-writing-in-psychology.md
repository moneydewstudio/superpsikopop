## What is the definition of automatic writing according to Psychologists?

automatic writing is Writing that is performed without conscious awareness by the writer. It is usually elicited under hypnosis, but it can be produced by sitting undisturbed for a long period and writing continuously with no attempt to control what is produced. After several hours, the product may give an uncensored glimpse into the unconscious. Or it may not.

Writing that is done without the writer even knowing they are doing it. This usually happens when someone is under hypnosis, but it can also happen when someone sits quietly for a long time and just writes whatever comes to mind without trying to control it. After a few hours of writing like this, the things that are written can show what a person is thinking or feeling without them trying to hide it. But sometimes, it doesn't really show anything important.
