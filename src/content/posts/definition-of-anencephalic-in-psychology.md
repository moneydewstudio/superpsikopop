> Without a cerebrum. Anencephalic infants usually survive for only a few days after birth, although some have been kept alive for up to six months. Anencephalic infants are of interest to students of neonate functioning, as observable differences between them and normal infants only seem to emerge after the first few weeks, implying that cerebral cortex activity may not play an important part in early infant behaviour. The well-documented case of Noah Wall, an apparently anencephalic infant who received intensive parental stimulation, showed significant development of the cerebrum after birth. Since Noah did have a residual amount of cerebral matter to begin with, it is not known whether such development would be possible with truly anencephalic infants. See also plasticity.

## What is the definition of anencephalic according to Psychologists?

anencephalic is Without a cerebrum. Anencephalic infants usually survive for only a few days after birth, although some have been kept alive for up to six months. Anencephalic infants are of interest to students of neonate functioning, as observable differences between them and normal infants only seem to emerge after the first few weeks, implying that cerebral cortex activity may not play an important part in early infant behaviour. The well-documented case of Noah Wall, an apparently anencephalic infant who received intensive parental stimulation, showed significant development of the cerebrum after birth. Since Noah did have a residual amount of cerebral matter to begin with, it is not known whether such development would be possible with truly anencephalic infants. See also plasticity.

Sometimes babies are born without a part of their brain called the cerebrum. These babies usually don't live very long, maybe only a few days or up to six months. Scientists are interested in studying these babies to see how they are different from normal babies. It seems that the differences only become noticeable after a few weeks, which suggests that the part of the brain called the cerebral cortex may not be very important in how babies behave when they are very young. There was a famous case of a baby named Noah Wall who was born without a cerebrum but received a lot of attention and care from his parents. He actually showed some development in the cerebrum after he was born, but it's unclear if this could happen for all babies born without a cerebrum. The ability of the brain to change and adapt is also something scientists are interested in, which is called plasticity.

## What are other terms related to anencephalic?

1\. Anencephalic: Anencephaly is a congenital disorder where a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull. These babies typically do not survive long after birth due to the severity of the condition.

2\. Conditioning: Conditioning refers to the process of learning associations between stimuli and responses. It can involve classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus, or operant conditioning, where behavior is strengthened or weakened based on its consequences.

3\. Cognitive Dissonance: Cognitive dissonance is a psychological term that describes the mental discomfort people experience when they hold conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes. This discomfort often motivates individuals to rationalize or change their beliefs to reduce the inconsistency.

4\. Defense Mechanisms: Defense mechanisms are unconscious psychological strategies that individuals use to cope with anxiety or protect their ego from threatening or uncomfortable thoughts or feelings. Common defense mechanisms include denial, repression, projection, and displacement.

5\. Observational Learning: Observational learning, also known as social learning or modeling, occurs when people acquire new knowledge, skills, or behaviors by observing and imitating others. This process plays a significant role in the development of social and cultural behaviors.
