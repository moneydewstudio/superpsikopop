## What is the definition of automatic routines according to Psychologists?

automatic routines is Actions or sequences of actions which have become so habitual that we no longer need to pay attention to them. Much complex skill learning consists of developing automatic routines (such as changing gear while driving). One of the most powerful demonstrations of automatic routines in cognition is the Stroop effect, which shows how the automatic subroutine of reading conflicts with the visual identification of colours. See automatisation.

Automatic routines are actions that we do without thinking because we have done them so many times before. For example, when we drive a car, we don't have to think about changing gears because it becomes automatic. When we learn new skills, we often develop these automatic routines to make things easier.

The Stroop effect is a way to show how automatic routines in our brains can sometimes cause conflicts. It happens when we try to identify colors but our automatic reading ability gets in the way. For example, if we see the word "blue" written in green ink, our brain might get confused because it automatically wants to read the word instead of recognizing the color. This shows how our automatic routines can sometimes interfere with what we see.

 

## What are the example case of automatic routines?

1\. Research on the impact of automatic routines on mental health: This study explores how relying on automatic routines for daily activities can lead to heightened stress levels and decreased overall well-being. It examines the negative effects of constantly performing tasks without conscious thought or attention.

2\. Cognitive psychology research on automaticity: This research investigates the cognitive processes underlying the development of automatic routines. It explores the neural mechanisms involved in forming and executing routines, and how they become ingrained in our behavior over time. It also delves into the factors that influence the efficiency and adaptability of automatic routines.

3\. Research on habitual behavior and goal-directed behavior: This study aims to understand the interplay between automatic routines and conscious decision-making. It explores how individuals switch between these two types of behavior and how automatic routines may hinder or enhance goal-directed behavior.

4\. Research on automating household chores: This research investigates the benefits and consequences of incorporating automatic routines in performing household tasks. It explores how automation can streamline mundane activities and create more leisure time for individuals, but also raises questions about the impact on human productivity and job displacement.

5\. Research on the role of automatic routines in skill acquisition: This study explores the relationship between automatic routines and skill acquisition. It delves into how repeated practice and the formation of routines contribute to the development of expertise in various domains, such as sports, music, and language learning.

6\. Research on the impact of automation on job performance: This research examines how the increasing reliance on automatic routines and technological automation affects job performance. It investigates how employees adapt to automated systems and how organizations can optimize the integration of automation without compromising human expertise and creativity.

7\. Research on the effects of interruption on automatic routines: This study explores how interruptions can disrupt the flow of automatic routines, leading to decreased efficiency and potentially errors. It investigates the factors that influence how individuals regain their focus and resume routine execution after an interruption.

8\. Research on the relationship between automatic routines and decision fatigue: This research investigates how the reliance on automatic routines can affect decision-making and cognitive resources. It explores the concept of decision fatigue, where individuals' ability to make efficient and effective decisions is compromised by the continuous execution of automatic routines.

These notable researches shed light on various aspects of automatic routines, including their impact on mental health, cognitive psychology, skill acquisition, job performance, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of automation.
