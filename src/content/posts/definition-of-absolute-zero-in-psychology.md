## What is the definition of absolute zero according to Psychologists?

absolute zero is The term is generally used to indicate a temperature of ?273°C, but it can also refer to the lowest possible point on any ratio scale.

Imagine you have a really cold day, so cold that everything outside freezes. Well, there's a point on a special temperature scale where it's as cold as things can possibly get. This point is called absolute zero. Absolute zero is like the super-duper coldest temperature ever. In fact, it's so cold that it's minus 273 degrees Celsius!

But wait, there's more! Absolute zero isn't just about temperature. It's like a secret code that tells us about the lowest possible point on any kind of scale that measures things. You know how you have a ruler to measure length and a clock to measure time? Well, scientists have special measuring scales too, called ratio scales. Absolute zero is the lowest point on these ratio scales too. It's like the bottom limit of what we can measure.

So, to sum it up, absolute zero is the coldest temperature ever, at minus 273 degrees Celsius. It's also the lowest point on special measuring scales that scientists use. It's all about how cold things can get and how low we can measure things.

 

## What are the example case of absolute zero?

One of the most famous and notable research related to the term "absolute zero" is the work done by Lord Kelvin, also known as William Thomson, in the 19th century.

Lord Kelvin's contribution was his formulation of the concept of the absolute temperature scale and his estimation of the value of absolute zero. He proposed that it is impossible to have a temperature lower than absolute zero, which serves as the lower limit of the temperature scale. Kelvin defined the Kelvin temperature scale, which is now widely used in scientific research.

In his research, Lord Kelvin discussed the laws of thermodynamics and the behavior of gases. He worked extensively on the relationship between temperature and energy. His calculations and observations on the expansion and cooling of gases led him to postulate that at absolute zero, all molecular motion would cease, and there would be no kinetic energy left.

Kelvin's research on absolute zero not only helped establish the concept of absolute temperature in thermodynamics but also made a significant impact on various scientific fields, such as physics and chemistry. The pursuit of reaching increasingly lower temperatures has led to important discoveries, including phenomena like superconductivity and Bose-Einstein condensation.

Lord Kelvin's work on absolute zero still remains influential and continues to be cited in numerous scientific publications and textbooks, solidifying his place as one of the most notable researchers in this field.
