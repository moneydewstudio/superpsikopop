## What is the definition of agnosia according to Psychologists?

agnosia is A disorder of cognitive processing in which the person cannot create any meaning out of their sensory inputs. See also integrative agnosia, Gerstmanns syndrome.

This is a description of a problem in the brain that affects how a person understands and makes sense of what they see, hear, touch, or feel. When someone has this disorder, their brain struggles to put all the information from their senses together to form a complete picture or understanding. It can be similar to other disorders that make it difficult to recognize objects or understand certain concepts.

 

## What are the example case of agnosia?

One of the most important and notable research studies regarding the term "agnosia" is the work done by Dr. Oliver Sacks on visual agnosia. Dr. Sacks wrote extensively on this topic and his book "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" includes a case study on a patient with visual agnosia, which helped shed light on the nature and impact of this condition.

Another significant research study on agnosia is "Prosopagnosia: A Clinical, Psychological, and Anatomical Study" by Bodamer (1947). This study provided a comprehensive understanding of prosopagnosia, a specific type of agnosia where individuals are unable to recognize familiar faces. Bodamer's research helped establish the neuroanatomical basis of prosopagnosia and contributed significantly to our understanding of face recognition.

More recently, a notable research study was conducted by Busigny and colleagues (2010) titled "The Role of the Right Inferior Temporal Cortex in the Right Hemisphere in Visual Form Agnosia." The study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the neural basis of visual form agnosia. The findings provided evidence that damage to the right inferior temporal cortex in the right hemisphere may lead to visual form agnosia, emphasizing the importance of this brain region in visual object recognition.

These studies, along with many others, have significantly contributed to our understanding of agnosia and have provided valuable insights into the nature, causes, and effects of this condition.
