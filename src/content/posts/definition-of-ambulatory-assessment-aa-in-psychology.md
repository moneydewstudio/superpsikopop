## What is the definition of ambulatory assessment (AA) according to Psychologists?

ambulatory assessment (AA) is A general term for a range of data-collection methods, including self-report, observation, and clinical or biological data collected in the course of the persons everyday life. It is mainly used in clinical contexts such as in health services. See also ambulatory self-report, Experience Sampling Method, Ecological Momentary Assessment, diary method.

This term refers to a bunch of different ways that information can be gathered for research, like asking people questions about themselves, watching how they behave, or collecting data about their health. These methods are often used in places like hospitals or clinics. Some specific examples of these methods include having people keep a record of their experiences throughout the day or using technology to collect information about someone's mood in real-time.

## What are other terms related to ambulatory assessment (AA)?

\- Definition: Ambulatory assessment (AA) refers to the monitoring and recording of physiological, behavioral, and environmental data as individuals go about their daily activities in their natural environment. - Wearable devices: These are small electronic devices that are worn on the body and used for ambulatory assessment. They can measure variables such as heart rate, blood pressure, physical activity, and sleep patterns. - Ecological momentary assessment (EMA): EMA is a method used in ambulatory assessment that involves collecting data from individuals in real-time, usually through self-reporting using electronic devices such as smartphones. This enables researchers to capture moment-to-moment fluctuations in variables of interest. - Experience sampling method (ESM): ESM is a specific type of ecological momentary assessment that involves sampling individuals' experiences and behaviors at random intervals throughout the day. Participants are typically prompted to complete brief assessments about their current thoughts, emotions, and activities. - Mobile sensing: This refers to the use of smartphones or other mobile devices to collect sensor-based data in ambulatory assessment. These devices can collect a wide range of data, including GPS location, accelerometer data, microphone data, and screen time, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of an individual's daily life.
