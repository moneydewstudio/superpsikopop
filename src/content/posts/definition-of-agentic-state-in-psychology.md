## What is the definition of agentic state according to Psychologists?

agentic state is The state proposed by Milgram in which the individual surrenders personal judgement and conscience to act as the agent of other people and do what they instruct. See autonomous state.

In simple terms, the state proposed by Milgram is when a person gives up their own thoughts and feelings to follow the instructions of others. It means they stop thinking for themselves and instead act based on what they are told to do. This state is called autonomous, which means independent or self-governing.

 

## What are the example case of agentic state?

One notable research related to the term "agentic state" is the Milgram experiment conducted by Stanley Milgram in the early 1960s. Milgram aimed to understand the obedience to authority in the context of Nazi war criminals' defenses during the Nuremberg Trials.

The experiment involved a participant (the "teacher") who was instructed to administer electric shocks to another person (the "learner") whenever they answered a question incorrectly. The shocks ranged from mild to dangerous levels, and the learner was actually an actor who was not receiving any real shocks. The crucial aspect of the experiment was that an authority figure (the "experimenter") in a lab coat instructed the teacher to continue administering the shocks, even when the learner expressed extreme discomfort and eventually stopped responding.

Milgram measured the level of obedience displayed by the participants, and interestingly, despite the apparent distress they experienced, around 65% of participants continued to administer shocks up to the highest level. Milgram argued that this obedience to authority occurred due to the participants' agentic state.

The concept of the agentic state refers to when an individual perceives themselves as an agent of another person or higher authority, relinquishing their personal responsibility for their actions. In this psychological state, individuals may act against their own moral compass and values, as they believe they are acting on behalf of someone else or following an authority figure's orders.

The Milgram experiment demonstrated the prevalence of the agentic state in situations where individuals feel compelled to obey authority, even if it means causing harm to others. This research had significant implications for understanding obedience and submission to authority, emphasizing the powerful influence authority figures can have on individuals' actions even in morally challenging situations.
