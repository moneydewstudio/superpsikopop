## What is the definition of autopagnosia according to Psychologists?

autopagnosia is An inability to localise body parts (e.g. pointing to the elbow instead of the knee) on oneself, other people or pictures, while still being able to use these parts effectively. This is one of the disorders that challenges the sensory-functional distinction.

Sometimes people have trouble knowing where their body parts are, like their elbow or their knee. They might confuse one body part for another, like pointing to their elbow when they actually meant to point to their knee. This can happen to themselves, other people, or even in pictures. This difficulty can make it hard for them to understand and distinguish between different body parts. However, even with this difficulty, they are still able to use these body parts properly and do things with them effectively. This problem challenges the way we usually understand and separate our senses from how our body functions.

 

## What are the example case of autopagnosia?

1\. One notable study on autotopagnosia is "Impaired body schema in patients with unilateral autotopagnosia" by Jeannerod M et al. (1994). This study investigated autotopagnosia in patients with lesions in the parietal lobe and found that these patients had difficulty identifying the location of body parts on themselves, indicating a disrupted body schema.

2\. Another important research is "Perception of body parts and sense of ownership in autotopagnosia" by Sirigu A et al. (1993). This study explored the sense of ownership and perception of body parts in patients with autotopagnosia. It found that these patients recognized their own body parts only through visual cues, while their sense of ownership and familiarity were preserved.

3\. The research "Disorders of body representation after brain damage: Spatial remapping of tactile stimuli" by Halligan PW et al. (1993) focused on the remapping of tactile stimuli in patients with autotopagnosia. The study revealed that these individuals had difficulty localizing tactile sensations on their own body, suggesting impairments in body representation.

4\. A study by Moro V et al. (2008) titled "When your arm becomes mine: Pathological embodiment of alien limbs using tools modulates own body representation" investigated the embodiment of alien limbs in patients with autotopagnosia. The research demonstrated that these patients exhibited a distorted perception of their own limbs when using tools, suggesting that impaired body representation extends to tool use.

5\. "The role of the right inferior parietal cortex in spatial remapping of tactile stimuli" by Karnath HO et al. (2005) explored the neural correlates of spatial remapping in patients with autotopagnosia. The study found that the right inferior parietal cortex plays a crucial role in spatial processing and remapping of tactile stimuli in these patients.

These notable research studies provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms and neural basis of autotopagnosia, contributing to a better understanding and potential treatment strategies for this condition.

 

## What are other terms related to autopagnosia?

1\. Agnosia: A neurological condition characterized by the inability to recognize or interpret sensory stimuli, such as objects or people, even though the person's senses are intact. 2. Visual Agnosia: A specific type of agnosia in which the person is unable to recognize visual stimuli, such as objects, faces, or colors, despite having normal vision. 3. Prosopagnosia: A specific type of visual agnosia characterized by the inability to recognize familiar faces, even though the person can see and describe facial features. 4. Simultanagnosia: A specific type of visual agnosia in which the person can perceive individual elements of a scene but has difficulty perceiving the entire scene as a whole. 5. Apperceptive Agnosia: A form of visual agnosia in which the person cannot perceive and recognize objects due to a disruption in early stages of visual processing, usually resulting from brain damage. 6. Associative Agnosia: A form of visual agnosia in which the person can perceive and see objects but has difficulty recognizing and attaching meaning to them due to damage in higher-level processing areas of the brain. 7. Topographical Agnosia: A specific type of agnosia in which the person is unable to recognize or navigate familiar environments, such as their own house or neighborhood. 8. Auditory Agnosia: A type of agnosia in which the person is unable to recognize and interpret sounds, including spoken words and environmental sounds, despite normal hearing ability. 9. Tactile Agnosia: A specific type of agnosia in which the person is unable to recognize or interpret objects through touch, commonly referred to as "astereognosis." 10. Akinetopsia: A specific type of visual agnosia in which the person is unable to perceive motion or moving objects, resulting in a deficiency in visual motion perception.
