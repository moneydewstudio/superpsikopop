> A finding in attribution theory that for unwanted events, people tend to make dispositional attributions about other peoples behaviour (e.g. if you drop a vase, I conclude that you are clumsy) while attributing their own behaviour primarily to the effects of external circumstances (if I drop the vase, it must be because it was slippery): a situational attribution. Research has found that depressed people are more likely to make dispositional attributions about bad events that affect them, while people in a good or loving relationship extend their situational explanations to their partners unwanted events.

## What is the definition of actorobserver effect according to Psychologists?

actorobserver effect is A finding in attribution theory that for unwanted events, people tend to make dispositional attributions about other peoples behaviour (e.g. if you drop a vase, I conclude that you are clumsy) while attributing their own behaviour primarily to the effects of external circumstances (if I drop the vase, it must be because it was slippery): a situational attribution. Research has found that depressed people are more likely to make dispositional attributions about bad events that affect them, while people in a good or loving relationship extend their situational explanations to their partners unwanted events.

Attribution theory is a way to understand why people behave the way they do. One finding in this theory is that when something bad happens, like if someone accidentally drops a vase, people usually think it's because of the person's personality, like they are clumsy. But when we do something bad, like dropping the vase ourselves, we tend to blame it on the situation, like it must have been slippery.

Researchers have also discovered that when people are feeling depressed, they are more likely to blame themselves for bad things happening to them. On the other hand, when people are in a happy and loving relationship, they tend to think that their partner's mistakes or accidents happened because of the situation, rather than blaming it on their partner's personality.



## What are the example case of actorobserver effect?

One of the most notable research studies regarding the actor-observer effect is the study conducted by Jones and Nisbett in 1972. Their study titled "The Actor and the Observer: Divergent Perceptions of the Causes of Behavior" aimed to investigate how individuals attribute the causes of their own behavior versus the behavior of others.

Jones and Nisbett conducted three experiments to examine the actor-observer effect. In their first experiment, they asked participants to write an essay either supporting or opposing Fidel Castro. After completing the essay, participants were then asked if they truly believed in the viewpoint they expressed. They found that participants who wrote an essay in favor of Castro were more likely to attribute their choice to external factors, such as the assigned position, while participants who wrote an essay opposing Castro attributed their choice to internal factors, such as personal beliefs.

In the second experiment, participants watched a person being interviewed on television delivering pro or anti-Castro statements. Participants then rated the interviewee's true feelings towards Castro. Jones and Nisbett found that participants who watched the pro-Castro interview attributed the person's positive statements to the external situation (the interview), while participants who watched the anti-Castro interview attributed the person's negative statements as a reflection of their true feelings.

Lastly, in the third experiment, participants were asked to evaluate the performance of a quiz show contestant who either did very well or very poorly. Participants who watched the successful contestant were more likely to attribute their success to internal factors, such as intelligence or competence, while participants who watched the unsuccessful contestant attributed their failure to external factors, such as bad luck or the difficulty of the questions.

Overall, these experiments conducted by Jones and Nisbett provided strong evidence for the actor-observer effect. They demonstrated that individuals tend to attribute their own behavior to external factors, while attributing others' behavior to internal factors. This research highlighted the role of perspective and situational attribution in shaping our understanding of the causes of behavior.



## What are other terms related to actorobserver effect?

Self-Serving Bias: The actorobserver effect is a specific manifestation of the more general self-serving bias, where individuals tend to attribute positive outcomes to their own internal qualities but attribute negative outcomes to external factors.

Perspective Differences: The effect is influenced by the perspective from which individuals view a situation. When people act, they are more likely to consider external factors that may have influenced their behavior. When observing others, the focus is often on internal characteristics.

Cognitive and Perceptual Factors: Cognitive and perceptual processes play a role in shaping attributions. When people reflect on their own behavior, they have access to more information about situational factors. When observing others, external cues may be less salient.

Cultural Variations: The actorobserver effect can vary across cultures. Some cultures may emphasize collective or situational influences more than individual characteristics, affecting how people attribute behavior.

Communication and Understanding: Recognizing the actorobserver effect is important for effective communication and interpersonal understanding. Misattributions of behavior can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts.
