## What is the definition of amusia according to Psychologists?

amusia is An inability to process music  that is, to perceive the sounds received as making up a musical form. Congenital amusia occurs when the amusia is a result of brain injury or misfunction.

When someone has difficulty understanding and enjoying music, we call it an inability to process music or congenital amusia. It can happen if a person's brain is injured or not functioning properly. This means that when they hear sounds that make up music, they have a hard time making sense of it or feeling the pleasure that others might experience.
