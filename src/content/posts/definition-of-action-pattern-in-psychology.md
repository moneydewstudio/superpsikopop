## What is the definition of action pattern according to Psychologists?

action pattern is See fixed action pattern.

Imagine you have a toy robot that repeats the same action over and over again whenever you press a button. This is similar to a fixed action pattern. It's a term used in biology to describe a specific behavior that animals do in response to a certain trigger or stimulus. Just like the robot, the animal will automatically carry out this behavior once it encounters the trigger, without really thinking about it. It's like a pre-programmed action that happens because the animal's instincts or genes tell it to.

 

## What are the example case of action pattern?

One of the most important and notable research regarding action patterns is the concept of fixed action patterns (FAPs) proposed by ethologist Niko Tinbergen. Tinbergen defined FAPs as stereotypical and instinctive behavioral sequences that are triggered by specific stimuli and are carried out to completion once started, regardless of the situation.

Tinbergen's research on FAPs formed the foundation for understanding innate behaviors in animals. He conducted extensive studies on the behavior of animals such as birds, fish, and insects, illustrating how certain stimuli can elicit predictable and complex patterns of actions. Tinbergen's work revealed that FAPs are genetically programmed and can be both beneficial and necessary for an organism's survival and reproductive success.

One of his notable studies involved the red spot on the beak of a herring gull chick. He discovered that when the chick pecks at the red spot on the beak of its parent, it triggers a FAP in the parent bird to regurgitate food for the chick. Tinbergen's research demonstrated the precise triggering mechanism of this action pattern and its importance for survival and parent-offspring relationships.

Tinbergen's contribution to the study of action patterns and innate behaviors laid the groundwork for further research in the field of ethology and behavioral biology. His work not only helped uncover the underlying genetic mechanisms controlling action patterns but also provided insights into the evolutionary significance of these behaviors.

 

## What are other terms related to action pattern?

Ethology (Animal Behavior): In the study of animal behavior, particularly in ethology, an action pattern refers to a stereotyped sequence of movements or behaviors exhibited by an organism in response to a specific stimulus. These patterns are often innate and part of the species' behavioral repertoire.

Psychology: In psychology, especially in behaviorism, the concept of action patterns may be used to describe learned sequences of behavior in response to specific stimuli. This could include learned behaviors or habits.

Human Movement Science: In the study of human movement, researchers might use the term to describe coordinated sequences of actions or movements, especially in sports or physical activities.

Human-Computer Interaction: In the context of human-computer interaction, an action pattern can refer to a sequence of user interactions or behaviors when engaging with a software interface or system.

Sociology: In sociology, the term might be used to describe recurrent, observable sequences of behavior within a social group or society.
