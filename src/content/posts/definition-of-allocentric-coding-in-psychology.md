## What is the definition of allocentric coding according to Psychologists?

allocentric coding is Visual coding that is independent of the observers perspective (e.g. connecting the features of two different objects with respect to one another, as opposed to egocentric coding).

Visual coding refers to how our brain processes and understands what we see. When we talk about it being independent of the observer's perspective, it means that our brain can identify and connect the features of different objects in relation to each other rather than just focusing on how we personally see or experience them.

For example, let's say you're looking at a picture of a cat and a ball. A person with an "egocentric coding" would only think about how they see the cat and ball from their own point of view. But with "independent visual coding," you would be able to understand how the cat relates to the ball regardless of your own position. You could think about how the cat is near the ball or how the cat's paw is reaching out towards the ball.

This kind of visual coding helps our brain to have a broader understanding of objects and how they interact with each other in the world, beyond just our own viewpoint.

 

## What are the example case of allocentric coding?

One notable research regarding allocentric coding is the study conducted by Moser et al. (2008) titled "Place Cells Representing Social Interactions". In this study, the researchers investigated how the brain's navigational system or hippocampus represents social information.

They trained rats to perform social interactions by having them interact with a conspecific (another rat) in different environments. Using electrodes implanted in the rats' hippocampi, the researchers recorded the activity of individual place cells - neurons that are known to fire and encode specific locations.

The researchers found that some place cells not only encoded the rat's position in the environment, but also encoded the position of the other rat in relation to the self. These cells fired in a predictable manner based on the relative positions of the two rats during the social interaction.

This study provided evidence for allocentric coding in the hippocampus for social interactions. It suggests that the allocentric coding system, typically associated with encoding spatial locations, can also be utilized to encode social or interpersonal information.

This research highlights the importance of understanding how the brain represents and processes social interactions, and how allocentric coding plays a role in this process. It provides insights into the neural mechanisms underlying our ability to navigate and interact socially in different environments.
