## What is the definition of apparent motion according to Psychologists?

apparent motion is A term used to describe visual illusions that provide an appearance of movement even when no such movement is actually occurring. Examples of this are found in the phi phenomenon, the autokinetic effect, the waterfall effect and stroboscopic motion stimuli.

A way to describe things that trick your eyes and make them think something is moving when it's not. It's kind of like when you see a picture that looks like it's moving, but really it's just a still picture. Some examples of this are when you see a light moving in the dark or when you look at a waterfall and it seems like the water is going up instead of down.

 

## What are the example case of apparent motion?

1\. "Apparent motion: Recent research and theories" by David Duncan and Deborah Amsel. This review paper discusses recent research on apparent motion, including studies on motion perception, attentional modulation, neural mechanisms, and theoretical models.

2\. "Perceptual grouping of apparent motion trajectories" by Aude Oliva and Antonio Torralba. This study investigates how the human visual system groups multiple stimuli into coherent motion trajectories. The researchers found that the grouping process is influenced by factors such as spatial proximity and common motion direction.

3\. "Apparent Motion and the Flash-Lag Effect" by Ulrik R. Beierholm et al. This research examines the relationship between apparent motion and the flash-lag effect, which is the perceptual phenomenon where a moving object is misperceived as being slightly behind a flash of light. The study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying this effect and proposes a computational model to explain the observations.

4\. "Apparent motion from high-density random lines: Visual short-term memory and predictive motion tracking" by Takeharu Seno et al. This study investigates how humans perceive apparent motion when viewing high-density random line stimuli. The researchers found evidence of predictive motion tracking, suggesting that the visual system integrates spatial and temporal information to perceive motion.

5\. "Apparent motion between two bands: interactions between luminance and chromatic signals" by Davide Fancourt et al. This research examines the perception of apparent motion between two bands of different colors (chromatic signals) and luminance. The study reveals complex interactions between these different visual signals and sheds light on how the visual system integrates them to perceive motion.

These are just a few notable research studies related to the term "apparent motion." There are many more studies available on this topic, covering various aspects of motion perception and the underlying mechanisms in the human visual system.

 

## What are other terms related to apparent motion?

1\. Phi phenomenon: Phi phenomenon refers to an illusion of apparent motion created when two or more stationary objects are presented in quick succession.

2\. Beta movement: Beta movement is a type of apparent motion where a single object appears to move back and forth in a rapid, repetitive manner.

3\. Stroboscopic motion: Stroboscopic motion occurs when a series of slightly different images are presented rapidly in succession, creating an illusion of motion.

4\. Animation: Animation is the technique of creating the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of static images in rapid succession.

5\. Flicker fusion: Flicker fusion refers to the phenomenon in which the human eye perceives a continuous motion when rapidly alternating between individual images or frames.

6\. Motion aftereffect: Motion aftereffect, also known as the waterfall illusion, is a visual phenomenon where the perception of motion continues after viewing a moving stimulus, creating a stationary object appearing to move.

7\. Autokinetic effect: The autokinetic effect is a perceptual phenomenon where a stationary point of light in complete darkness appears to move spontaneously due to the inability of the visual system to stabilize the image.

8\. Tachistoscope: A tachistoscope is a device used to present visual stimuli for a very brief duration, often used in research on apparent motion perception.

9\. Perceptual rivalry: Perceptual rivalry refers to the phenomenon where two or more incompatible perceptual interpretations compete for dominance, resulting in alternations in perception.

10\. Illusory motion: Illusory motion is the perception of motion that does not actually exist or is different from the physical movement, often created through visual illusions.
