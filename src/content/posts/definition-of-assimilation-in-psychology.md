## What is the definition of assimilation according to Psychologists?

assimilation is One of two processes by which a schema in Piagetian theory is considered to develop. New information is said to have been assimilated when it is fitted into an existing schema and so can be understood in relation to earlier learning. Assimilation and accommodation are considered to be continuous cognitive processes, contributing to cog- nitive adaptation. See also equilibration.

Assimilation is like when you have a puzzle and you already have some pieces that fit together. When you find a new piece that also fits, you can add it to the puzzle and it makes sense because it goes along with what you already know. It's like when you learn something new and it's similar to things you already know, so it's easier to understand.

Accommodation is a little different. It's like when you have a puzzle and you find a piece that doesn't fit with the ones you already have. So you have to change or adjust the puzzle a little bit to make the new piece fit. It's like when you learn something new and it's different from what you already know, so you have to change your thinking a bit to understand it.

Overall, assimilation and accommodation are ways our brains learn and adapt to new information. They help us make sense of things and fit them into what we already know.
