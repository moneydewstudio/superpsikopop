## What is the definition of aberrant according to Psychologists?

aberrant is Behaviour (or in biology, an organism) that deviates from what is normal, expected or desirable.

Imagine you have a class of students and they all behave in a certain way. Sometimes, one student may start behaving differently from the others. This is called deviant behavior. It means that the student is doing something that is not normal or expected in the classroom. For example, if everyone is sitting quietly and listening to the teacher, but one student starts talking loudly or disrupting the class, that would be considered deviant behavior. It's like when a plant or animal does something that is not typical or desirable for its species.

 

## What are the example case of aberrant?

One of the notable research papers regarding the term "aberrant" is "Aberrant methylome in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from Parkinson's disease patients" published in Cell Stem Cell in 2012. The study was conducted by M.J. Sanchez-Danes et al. and explored the epigenetic differences in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neurons from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, compared to healthy individuals.

The researchers identified aberrant DNA methylation patterns in the iPSC-derived neurons from PD patients, which were distinct from healthy participants. These aberrations were associated with changes in gene expression, contributing to the pathogenesis of PD. The study provided valuable insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying PD and highlighted the importance of studying aberrant methylation in neurodegenerative disorders.

Another prominent research on the term "aberrant" is "Aberrant Crypt Foci: The Case for Inclusion as a Biomarker for Colon Cancer" published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention in 2008. The study by E. R. Siegel et al. examined the prevalence and significance of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon, specifically as a potential biomarker for colon cancer.

The researchers reviewed various studies and concluded that aberrant crypt foci are reliable biomarkers that precede the formation of colon cancer. ACFs represent histological changes in the colonic epithelium, including abnormal glandular architecture and crypt dysplasia. Their presence and characteristics provide early indicators of colon neoplasia. The research emphasized the importance of ACFs in colon cancer detection and prevention strategies.

These are just two examples of notable research papers regarding the term "aberrant." Depending on the specific context or field, there may be numerous other studies or notable works using the term.

 

## What are other terms related to aberrant?

"Aberrant" in psychology is often used to describe behavior or characteristics that deviate from the norm or typical patterns. Here are some related terms:

1\. \*\*Aberrant Behavior:\*\* Behavior that is unusual, deviating from what is considered typical or normal.

2\. \*\*Deviation from the Mean:\*\* A statistical measure indicating how much a particular score in a distribution differs from the mean (average).

3\. \*\*Outlier:\*\* An observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population.

4\. \*\*Psychopathology:\*\* The study of mental disorders or abnormal behavior.

5\. \*\*Anomalous:\*\* Something that is different from what is expected or usual.

6\. \*\*Maladaptive Behavior:\*\* Behavior that is ineffective or counterproductive in meeting the demands of a particular situation.

7\. \*\*Nonconformity:\*\* Deviating from established customs, attitudes, or norms.

8\. \*\*Atypical:\*\* Not typical, deviating from the norm or average.

9\. \*\*Dysfunction:\*\* Impaired or abnormal functioning, often used in the context of mental health.

10\. \*\*Idiosyncrasy:\*\* A mode of behavior or way of thought peculiar to an individual; an individual's distinctive or peculiar feature or characteristic.
