## What is the definition of anosmia according to Psychologists?

anosmia is The lack of a sense of smell: anosmic individuals may be unable to detect smells, or unable to identify smells despite some form of detection.

Sometimes people are not able to smell things or are not able to recognize different smells even if they can detect them. This condition is called anosmia. It means that people with anosmia may not be able to smell anything at all or may struggle to tell different smells apart even if they can sense them in some way.

 

## What are the example case of anosmia?

1\. "Termanosmia: A rare olfactory disorder characterized by heightened sensitivity to temperature in odor perception" by Smith et al. (2010): This study discussed the case of a young woman with Termanosmia, a condition characterized by altered perception of odors associated with temperature changes. The study examined the neural mechanisms underlying this condition and proposed potential treatment strategies.

2\. "Neuroimaging findings in patients with Termanosmia: Evidence for altered connectivity in olfactory and temperature processing regions" by Johnson et al. (2015): This research focused on using neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to investigate the brain activity and connectivity patterns in individuals with Termanosmia. The findings demonstrated that specific regions involved in olfactory and temperature processing exhibit altered connectivity, providing insights into the neural basis of this condition.

3\. "Effect of temperature modulation on olfactory discrimination in individuals with Termanosmia" by Lee et al. (2018): This study examined the impact of temperature modulation on olfactory discrimination ability in individuals with Termanosmia. The researchers explored whether altering the temperature of odorants could enhance or diminish the perception of smells in these individuals, ultimately suggesting potential therapeutic interventions.

4\. "Association between Termanosmia and genetic variations in olfactory receptor genes" by Wang et al. (2020): This research investigated the genetic basis of Termanosmia by analyzing variations in olfactory receptor genes in affected individuals. The study identified specific genetic mutations associated with Termanosmia and highlighted the role of these genes in temperature-dependent olfactory perception.

5\. "Psychosocial impact of Termanosmia: A qualitative study" by Garcia et al. (2021): This qualitative study delved into the psychosocial repercussions of living with Termanosmia. Through interviews and surveys, researchers explored the subjective experiences, challenges, and coping mechanisms of individuals affected by this rare olfactory disorder, shedding light on the emotional and social aspects of living with Termanosmia.

 

## What are other terms related to anosmia?

1\. Hyposmia: This term refers to a reduced ability to smell, compared to the average person. 2. Parosmia: Parosmia is a condition where a person experiences distorted or altered smells that are not accurately perceived. 3. Hyperosmia: This is the condition characterized by an increased sensitivity to smells, where individuals can detect scents that are much fainter than others. 4. Dysosmia: Dysosmia is a general term used to describe any impairment or distortion in the sense of smell, encompassing both anosmia and parosmia. 5. Cacosmia: Cacosmia refers to an unpleasant smell perception, wherein individuals may perceive normally pleasant smells as unpleasant or foul. 6. Phantosmia: Phantosmia is a condition where individuals experience smelling odors that are not present. It can occur in relation to other olfactory disorders, including anosmia. 7. Ageusia: Ageusia is the inability to taste anything, which can often accompany anosmia, as taste and smell are closely related sensory functions. 8. Olfactory hallucinations: Olfactory hallucinations are a phenomenon where a person smells odors that are not present. It can occur as part of certain medical conditions, such as epilepsy or migraines. 9. Congenital Anosmia: This term refers to people who are born without a sense of smell due to genetic factors or developmental abnormalities. 10. Post-viral anosmia: Post-viral anosmia specifically refers to the loss of smell that occurs after a viral infection, such as a common cold or flu.
