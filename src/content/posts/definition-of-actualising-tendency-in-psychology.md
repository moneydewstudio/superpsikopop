## What is the definition of actualising tendency according to Psychologists?

actualising tendency is A term coined by Rogers (1951) to describe the process by which people seek to develop their various potentials and to maximise their personal growth, once their need for positive regard from others has been satisfied. See also self-actualisation.

This term "self-actualization" was made up by a guy named Rogers in 1951. It means that once you feel accepted and loved by others, you start trying to become the best version of yourself. You want to reach your full potential and grow as a person. It's like when you feel good about yourself, you want to keep improving and becoming even better.

 

## What are the example case of actualising tendency?

One of the most notable pieces of research regarding the term "actualizing tendency" is the theory of self-actualization proposed by humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow. While Maslow did not use the exact term "actualizing tendency," his concept of self-actualization is closely related.

Maslow's theory suggests that every individual has an inherent drive to reach their full potential and become the best version of themselves, which he referred to as self-actualization. This concept is linked to the idea of an actualizing tendency, the idea that all living organisms have an innate drive to develop and grow in a way that is consistent with their nature.

Maslow's theory of self-actualization was first introduced in his 1954 book "Motivation and Personality" and was later expanded upon in subsequent works. He conducted extensive case studies and analyzed the lives of exceptional individuals like Albert Einstein and Eleanor Roosevelt to determine the characteristics and behaviors associated with self-actualization.

This research has had a significant impact on the field of psychology, particularly in the areas of humanistic and positive psychology. Maslow's theory of self-actualization has influenced various aspects of psychology, including development of personality theories, understanding human motivation, and fostering personal growth and well-being.

Moreover, this research has extended beyond psychology to fields such as education, management, and counseling, where it has been utilized to enhance learning environments, motivate employees, and promote personal growth and self-fulfillment.

Overall, Maslow's theory of self-actualization and the concept of an actualizing tendency have contributed greatly to our understanding of how individuals strive for personal growth and achievement, highlighting the importance of fulfilling our unique potentials.

Self-Actualization: The actualizing tendency is closely linked to the concept of self-actualization. Rogers believed that individuals have an innate drive to become the best version of themselves and to realize their full potential.

Unconditional Positive Regard: Rogers proposed that creating a supportive and non-judgmental environment, characterized by unconditional positive regard, facilitates the actualizing tendency.

This is because external judgments and expectations may lead individuals to pursue goals that are not authentic to their true selves.

Subjective Experience: The actualizing tendency is a subjective experience, and what it means for each person is unique. It involves a process of becoming more self-aware, authentic, and aligned with one's true values and aspirations.
