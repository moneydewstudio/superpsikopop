## What is the definition of balance theory according to Psychologists?

balance theory is The idea that we need to maintain a state of cognitive equilibrium between the different attitudes that we hold, and that our social cognitions will, if necessary, become modified in order to create or perpetuate such a balance. Cognitive dissonance is a variant of this theory.

Sometimes we have different thoughts or attitudes that don't match up with each other. But, our brains like to keep things in balance, so we try to find a way to make our thoughts line up and match. We might change our beliefs or opinions to make them fit better with each other and maintain a balanced state of mind. This is called cognitive equilibrium.

However, there are times when our thoughts are so different and don't match up that it creates a feeling of discomfort or conflict in our minds. This feeling is called cognitive dissonance. It means that we're aware of the inconsistency in our thoughts, and it can make us feel uneasy. To resolve this discomfort, we might need to change our thoughts or attitudes to make them match and bring back that balance in our thinking.

2\. "A Test of Cognitive Balance Theory" by Newcomb, Theodore M. (1953) - This study focused on testing the predictions of Cognitive Balance Theory. It involved examining the attitudes and relationships among individuals in small groups to determine if cognitive balance or imbalance existed.

3\. "Balance Theory and Interpersonal Relations" by Osgood, Charles E. and Tannenbaum, Percy H.

4\. "Balance Theory in Social Psychology: Cognitive Representations of Attitudes" by Abelson, Robert P. and Rosenberg, Milton J. (1958) - This study delved into the cognitive representations of attitudes and how they align or conflict with Balance Theory.

5\. "Balance Theory Revisited: Reconsidering Cognitive Consistency" by Masin, Sergio C. and Bareket-Bojmel, Lihi (2018) - This recent research revisited Balance Theory and offered a critical analysis of its assumptions and potential limitations. It raised questions about the complexity of attitudes and the reality of cognitive consistency in the real world, suggesting the need for further investigation.

6\. "Cognitive Balance, Cognitive Dissonance, and Affective Valuation" by Rabinowitz, Victoria C. (1997) - This study examined the relationship between Balance Theory, cognitive dissonance, and affective valuation.
