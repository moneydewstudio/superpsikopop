> A classification of children who are judged to have an inability to sustain attention. Such children are likely to be disruptive in school or at home, and if the condition is serious they are likely to have educational difficulties. The use of this diagnostic label means that the condition can be treated as a kind of illness. Previously, these children were labelled as hyperactive or as suffering from minimal brain damage. ADD is often treated with drugs such as Ritalin, which are related to amphetamines. Although these drugs are usually used as stimulants, they also help to maintain attention, which seems to be the effect that is helpful to those concerned.

## What is the definition of attention deficit disorder (ADD) according to Psychologists?

attention deficit disorder (ADD) is A classification of children who are judged to have an inability to sustain attention. Such children are likely to be disruptive in school or at home, and if the condition is serious they are likely to have educational difficulties. The use of this diagnostic label means that the condition can be treated as a kind of illness. Previously, these children were labelled as hyperactive or as suffering from minimal brain damage. ADD is often treated with drugs such as Ritalin, which are related to amphetamines. Although these drugs are usually used as stimulants, they also help to maintain attention, which seems to be the effect that is helpful to those concerned.

This is a way to describe children who have trouble paying attention for a long time. These children often cause disruptions at school or at home, and if it's a serious problem, they might have trouble learning. We call this issue Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and it is treated like an illness. In the past, these children were called "hyperactive" or had "minimal brain damage." To help with their attention, doctors sometimes give them medicine like Ritalin. This medicine is similar to drugs that make people feel more energetic, but for these children, it helps them focus better.

 

## What are the example case of attention deficit disorder (ADD)?

1\. The Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA Study): This landmark study examined the effectiveness of different treatment approaches for children with ADHD, including medication, behavior therapy, and a combination of both. It found that medication alone and medication combined with behavioral interventions were the most effective treatments.

2\. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Follow-up (MTA-Follow-up Study): This long-term follow-up study of the MTA study participants assessed the outcomes of different treatment approaches over an extended period. It found that while medication led to immediate symptom reduction, the effects diminished over time, highlighting the need for ongoing intervention and support.

3\. The CADDRA Canadian ADHD Practice Guidelines: These guidelines were developed by the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (CADDRA) and provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults. The guidelines incorporate extensive research findings and clinical expertise to guide healthcare professionals in managing ADHD.

4\. The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R): This large-scale survey assessed the prevalence of various mental disorders in the United States, including ADHD. It estimated that 4.4% of adults in the U.S. had ADHD at some point in their lives, highlighting the significant impact of the disorder on the population.

5\. The Genetic investigations of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have revealed various genetic factors contributing to the development of ADHD. Studies have highlighted the involvement of multiple genes related to neurotransmitter regulation, specifically dopamine, which plays a crucial role in attention and impulse control.

6\. The Prevalence of ADHD Among U.S. Adults: Results from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health study found that the prevalence of ADHD among adults in the United States was higher than previously estimated, affecting approximately 8.1% of adults.

7\. The Impact of ADHD on Educational Outcomes: Numerous studies have examined the impact of ADHD on academic performance and educational outcomes. Research suggests that children with ADHD are more likely to experience academic underachievement, grade retention, and school dropout compared to their non-ADHD peers.

8\. The Impact of ADHD on Occupational Functioning: Studies have also examined the impact of ADHD on occupational outcomes in adulthood. Findings suggest that adults with ADHD may experience difficulties in maintaining employment, higher rates of unemployment, and lower occupational attainment compared to those without ADHD.

These notable research studies contribute to our understanding of attention deficit disorder (ADD) and provide valuable insights into its diagnosis, treatment, prevalence, genetic factors, and impact on various aspects of life.

3\. Inattentive Type: One of the subtypes of ADHD, characterized by symptoms of inattention without hyperactivity or impulsivity.

4\. Hyperactive Type: One of the subtypes of ADHD, characterized by symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity without significant inattentiveness.
