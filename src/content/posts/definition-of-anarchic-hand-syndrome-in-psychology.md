## What is the definition of anarchic hand syndrome according to Psychologists?

anarchic hand syndrome is Complex goal-directed movements of the hand that are not voluntarily directed by the hands owner. See also split-brain studies.

Complex goal-directed movements of the hand are when your hand does things without you telling it to. Like when you reach out to grab something without thinking about it. Split-brain studies are experiments that study how the two halves of our brain work together.

 

## What are the example case of anarchic hand syndrome?

Anarchic hand syndrome, also known as alien hand syndrome, is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the involuntary actions and movements of one hand, which appear to be independent of the person's conscious control. The research on this syndrome has helped in understanding its underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and management approaches. Here are some of the most important and notable research studies on anarchic hand syndrome:

1\. "Alien Hand Syndrome: A Review of the Psychological and Neural Correlates" by J. Jankovic and J. Vuong: This comprehensive review article discusses the clinical features, etiology, and neuroanatomical basis of the syndrome. It provides an overview of the historical background, diagnostic criteria, and various associated disorders.

2\. "The Nature and Etiology of Alien Hand Syndrome" by F. Bogen: This seminal paper proposed a neuroanatomical explanation for alien hand syndrome. Bogen suggested that disconnection between the cerebral hemispheres, particularly the corpus callosum (the main communication pathway between the hemispheres), could lead to the emergent behavior of an alien hand.

3\. "Putative Anatomical Basis of Alien Hand Syndrome in Corticobasal Degeneration" by E. Assal et al.: This study used structural imaging techniques, such as MRI, to investigate the neuroanatomical basis of the syndrome. The researchers identified certain brain areas, including the supplementary motor area and the frontal lobes, as being linked to the occurrence of alien hand syndrome in patients with corticobasal degeneration.

4\. "Sense of Agency and Alien Hand Syndrome" by P. Haggard et al.: This study aimed to understand how patients with alien hand syndrome perceive their involuntary hand movements. The researchers found that individuals with the syndrome often lack a sense of agency, meaning that they do not feel that the movements are self-initiated.

5\. "Treatment of Alien Hand Syndrome with Botulinum Toxin" by D. Pérez-Sanpablo et al.: This study explored the use of botulinum toxin injections as a potential treatment for the syndrome. The researchers reported successful outcomes, with a reduction in involuntary movements and increased hand control in patients.

These research studies, along with others in the field, have contributed to our understanding of anarchic hand syndrome, its etiology, and management options. However, it is important to note that due to its rarity, research on this syndrome remains limited, and further studies are needed to fully comprehend its underlying mechanisms.

 

## What are other terms related to anarchic hand syndrome?

1\. Anarchic hand syndrome: A neurological disorder characterized by the involuntary, uncontrollable movement of one hand, often conflicting with the person's intention to control or use the hand.

2\. Cognitive dissonance: The mental discomfort experienced when individuals hold contradictory beliefs or attitudes and are motivated to reduce this discomfort by either changing their beliefs or justifying them.

3\. Confirmation bias: The tendency to seek, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs or expectations, while ignoring or discounting contradictory evidence.

4\. Dissociative identity disorder (DID): A psychological condition where an individual experiences two or more distinct personality states or identities, accompanied by gaps in memory, often due to severe childhood trauma.

5\. Self-actualization: The process of fulfilling one's potential and striving for personal growth, achieved by fulfilling basic needs, developing relationships, and pursuing meaningful goals.
