## What is the definition of alienist according to Psychologists?

alienist is An early title for psychiatrists, who treated aliens (insane people).

A long time ago, there were some doctors called psychiatrists who took care of people with mental health issues. They had a different name at that time, and they were known as the doctors who helped the "aliens." Now, don't get confused, we're not talking about the space aliens here! In those days, they used the word "aliens" to describe people who were very sick in their minds, often called insane. These special doctors worked to help those individuals feel better and become mentally well again.

 

## What are the example case of alienist?

The term "alienist" refers to a now-outdated term for a psychiatrist or mental health professional. Here are some significant research studies related to the field of psychiatry:

1\. Psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud: Freud is often considered the founder of psychoanalysis, a therapeutic approach for understanding and treating mental disorders. His various works, including "The Interpretation of Dreams" and "Civilization and Its Discontents," have significantly influenced the field of psychiatry.

2\. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM): The DSM is a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association that provides a common language and criteria for diagnosing mental illnesses. Its latest edition, DSM-5, has undergone significant research and revisions to improve the accuracy and validity of psychiatric diagnoses.

3\. Study on the Efficacy of Antipsychotic Medications: A landmark study conducted by the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) examined the effectiveness of various antipsychotic medications in treating schizophrenia. It aimed to determine which medications work best for different individuals, leading to more personalized treatment approaches.

4\. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Study: This study, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Kaiser Permanente, linked childhood trauma and adverse experiences (such as abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction) with a higher likelihood of developing mental health issues and physical health problems later in life.

5\. The Global Burden of Disease Study: This ongoing research project attempts to quantify the burden of mental disorders on global health by analyzing the prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with different mental illnesses. It helps to highlight the significant impact of mental health disorders and inform policy and resource allocation decisions.

Please note that the term "alienist" is no longer widely used or recognized in the field of mental health. The current and preferred term is "psychiatrist" or "psychologist."
