## What is the definition of association according to Psychologists?

association is The linking of one thing with another in sequence. Associative learning is learning that has been acquired as a result of the connection of a stimulus with a response. During the period when psychology was attempting to account for all behaviours as stimulusresponse connections, association was seen as the central psychological process underpinning all others.

Linking things together in a certain order is called associative learning. This means that we learn something by connecting it to something else. For example, when we hear a certain sound, we might automatically think of a specific response or action. Associative learning was once thought to be the most important way that we learn things in psychology, because it helps us understand how all our different behaviors are connected.
