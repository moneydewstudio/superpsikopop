## What is the definition of accounts according to Psychologists?

accounts is The verbal descriptions that people give of their experiences. An interpretivist approach treats the account as the object of study in its own right. For example, if someone describes getting angry during an interaction, the account might be taken as indicating something about their private emotional state. Alternatively, researchers might study the description itself as an example of the form and features of accounts of emotional experiences. See also qualitative analysis.

Verbal descriptions mean the words that people use to explain their experiences. An interpretivist approach means looking at these descriptions as the main thing to study. For example, if someone talks about getting angry during a conversation, we might think their words tell us something about how they felt inside. Or, researchers might look at the description itself to see how people usually talk about their emotions. This is also called qualitative analysis, where we look at the quality of the information rather than just numbers and statistics.
