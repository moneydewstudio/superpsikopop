## What is the definition of akinetopsia according to Psychologists?

akinetopsia is A type of specific brain damage that impairs the perception of movement without damaging other functions. See V5.

There's a certain kind of problem that can happen in the brain that affects how someone sees movement. This problem doesn't harm their other abilities, just their ability to understand movement. It's connected to a specific brain area called V5.

 

## What are the example case of akinetopsia?

One of the most notable research papers on akinetopsia is titled "Motion Blindness and the Motion Aftereffect: A Case Study" by Zihl, von Cramon, and Mai (1983). This study reported a detailed case study of patient LM who had acquired akinetopsia as a result of bilateral occipital lesions. The study provided significant insights into the mechanisms underlying motion perception and the specific visual deficits associated with akinetopsia. It demonstrated that while LM exhibited intact form vision and object recognition, he was unable to perceive motion or detect any movement, leading to his complete motion blindness.

This seminal research established akinetopsia as a distinct visual deficit and opened up further investigations into the functional and neural basis of motion perception. It formed a foundation for subsequent studies that have examined the neural correlates of motion blindness using neuroimaging techniques, advanced our understanding of the processing of visual motion information in the brain, and identified potential therapeutic approaches for individuals with akinetopsia.
