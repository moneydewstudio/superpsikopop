> The part of the limbic system that is particularly fundamental to emotion and emotional memory. It is a pair of almond-shaped structures located deep within the medial temporal lobes and quite close to the hippocampus.The amygdala has neural connections right across the brain. It has been shown to be involved in a wide range  possibly all  emotional experiences, including happiness, fear, empathy, friendship, humour, prejudice, and bereavement; linking with the insula to regulate and control negative emotions such as anger, and linking with the hippocampus in consolidating emotional memories.

## What is the definition of amygdala according to Psychologists?

amygdala is The part of the limbic system that is particularly fundamental to emotion and emotional memory. It is a pair of almond-shaped structures located deep within the medial temporal lobes and quite close to the hippocampus.The amygdala has neural connections right across the brain.

The amygdala is a very important part of our brain that helps us experience and remember emotions. It is shaped like two almonds and is located deep inside our brain. It is very close to another part called the hippocampus. The amygdala is connected to many different parts of our brain. It helps us feel a wide range of emotions like happiness, fear, empathy, friendship, humor, prejudice, and sadness when someone passes away. It also works with another part of the brain called the insula to help us control negative emotions like anger. Additionally, it works with the hippocampus to store emotional memories. People with a condition called Kluver-Bucy syndrome may have problems with their amygdala and experience changes in their behavior and emotions.

## What are other terms related to amygdala?

\- Amygdala: The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped brain structure located deep within the temporal lobe of the brain. It plays a crucial role in processing emotions, memory formation, and the fight-or-flight response.

Related terms: 1. Emotion: Emotion refers to a complex psychological state involving subjective feelings, physiological changes, and behavioral responses. The amygdala is involved in the processing, regulation, and expression of emotions. 2. Fear: Fear is an emotional response to specific threats or dangers. The amygdala plays a central role in fear processing by detecting and responding to potential threats in the environment. 3. Emotional memory: Emotional memory refers to the storage and recollection of memories that are linked to emotional experiences. The amygdala plays a key role in encoding and consolidating emotional memories. 4. PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder): PTSD is a mental health disorder that can develop after exposure to a traumatic event. The amygdala's hyperactivation and difficulty in extinguishing fear responses are implicated in the development and persistence of PTSD symptoms. 5. Anxiety: Anxiety is a common mental health condition characterized by excessive worry, unease, and fear. The amygdala is involved in the processing and regulation of anxiety responses. 6. Stress: Stress is the body's response to challenging or threatening situations. The amygdala is part of the brain's stress response system, known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. 7. Pavlovian conditioning: Pavlovian conditioning, also known as classical conditioning, is a type of associative learning where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a specific response through repeated pairings. The amygdala is essential for mediating the emotional and conditioned responses in these learning processes. 8. Aggression: Aggression refers to behaviors characterized by physical or verbal hostility, with the intention to cause harm. The amygdala plays a role in the regulation and expression of aggression. 9. Emotional regulation: Emotional regulation refers to the ability to modulate and control one's emotions. The amygdala is involved in both the generation and regulation of emotions, working in conjunction with other brain regions. 10. Social cognition: Social cognition involves the mental processes and abilities required for social interactions and understanding others' thoughts, feelings, and intentions. The amygdala is implicated in social cognition, particularly in perceiving and processing emotional facial expressions.
