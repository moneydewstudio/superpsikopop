## What is the definition of acquired dyslexia according to Psychologists?

acquired dyslexia is Dyslexia that has come about as a result of an accident, stroke or illness.

Dyslexia is a reading problem that can happen when someone has an accident, stroke, or gets sick. It makes it hard for them to read words and understand them correctly.

 

## What are the example case of acquired dyslexia?

One notable research study regarding acquired dyslexia is the research conducted by Marshall and Newcombe (1973) titled "Patterns of acquired dyslexia: A neuropsychological investigation of reading and spelling." This study aimed to explore the various patterns of acquired dyslexia among patients with brain damage, specifically examining the impaired reading and spelling abilities in relation to specific types of brain lesions.

Another significant research paper is "Acquired phonological dyslexia" by Shallice and Warrington (1975). In this study, the researchers explored the phenomenon of acquired phonological dyslexia, where individuals have particular difficulty reading non-words or pseudowords. The paper describes the case studies of several patients and presents evidence suggesting that phonological deficits can arise due to specific types of brain damage.

Furthermore, a study conducted by Dehaene et al. (2005) titled "Reading-induced plasticity in the left occipito-temporal cortex in dyslexia" investigated the neural changes associated with reading improvement in individuals with acquired dyslexia. The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the brain activity of dyslexic adults before and after an intensive training program. The findings demonstrated that individuals with dyslexia could exhibit significant neural plasticity and reading improvements after training, suggesting the possibility of targeted interventions.

These are just a few examples of the notable research conducted on acquired dyslexia. There is a vast body of literature on this topic, and further exploration of the scientific databases can provide more detailed insights into this area of study.

 

## What are other terms related to acquired dyslexia?

Phonological Alexia (Surface Dyslexia): Individuals with this type of acquired dyslexia may struggle with reading irregular words (words that don't follow typical phonetic rules) but may be able to read regular words and non-words. There's difficulty with the whole-word reading strategy.

Deep Dyslexia: People with deep dyslexia may have difficulty with both regular and irregular words. They often make semantic errors (substituting one word for another with a related meaning) and may struggle with non-words.

Spatial Alexia (Neglect Dyslexia): This form is associated with visual neglect, where individuals have difficulty attending to one side of the visual field. As a result, they may omit words or parts of words on one side of the page.

Pure Alexia (Alexia without Agraphia): Individuals with pure alexia can write but have difficulty reading. This is often associated with damage to the left visual cortex.

Attentional Dyslexia: Individuals may have difficulty sustaining attention during reading, leading to omissions or substitutions of words.
