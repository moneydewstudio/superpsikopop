## What is the definition of angst according to Psychologists?

angst is A mental disquiet or anguish considered by supporters of existentialism to be the inevitable outcome of a full appreciation of the implications of personal responsibility and personal choice.

Existentialism is a way of thinking that says life can be really tough and confusing because we have the power to make our own decisions and choices. When we understand this, it can make us feel worried or upset inside. This is because we realize that we are responsible for our own actions and the things that happen to us. It's like having a lot of thoughts and feelings that make us feel uncomfortable or uneasy.

 

## What are the example case of angst?

While specific research on the term "termangst" may be limited, I can provide you with information on its origin and notable research on related concepts such as "existential anxiety" or "academic anxiety."

1\. Origin of Termangst: The term "termangst" is a portmanteau of "term" (referring to the academic semester) and "angst" (a German word meaning anxiety or fear). It is commonly used colloquially to describe the anxiety or stress experienced by students during the term or semester.

2\. Academic Anxiety/Stress among Students: - A study titled "Academic Stress, Anxiety, and Depression among College Students - A Brief Review," by Yousafzai, M., et al. (2014), explores the prevalence of academic stress, anxiety, and depression among college students and its impact on their psychological well-being. - "Stress and Anxiety among University Students: A Comparative Study," conducted by Kahu, E. R., et al. (2015), compares the levels of stress and anxiety among university students in various countries, highlighting the common challenges and potential differences. - In a study titled "Academic Stress and its Relation to Anxiety in College Students," Othman, N., & Ahmad, F. (2017), investigate the relationship between academic stress and anxiety levels among college students, emphasizing the need for intervention strategies.

3\. Existential Anxiety: - Research on existential anxiety focuses on the broader concept of a profound sense of fear, dread, or apprehension regarding the meaning, purpose, and ultimate fate of life. Although not directly related to "termangst," exploring existential anxiety might provide insights into the underlying factors contributing to academic stress and anxiety. - "Existential Anxiety: Theory and Measurement," a study by DeBeek, R., et al. (2002), discusses various theoretical perspectives on existential anxiety and proposes a comprehensive model for assessing this type of anxiety. - In "Existential Anxiety: A Concept Analysis," Karlsson, G., et al. (2017), provide an analysis of existing research on existential anxiety and its implications for nursing care.

Note: While these studies do not specifically focus on the term "termangst," they discuss related aspects of academic anxiety, stress, and existential anxiety, which may help to elucidate the concept you are interested in exploring.
