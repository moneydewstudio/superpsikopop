## What is the definition of abnormal psychology according to Psychologists?

abnormal psychology is An old term for the psychology of abnormal behaviour. This term has been largely replaced by clinical psychology when referring to professional practice.

Abnormal behavior used to be a way to describe how people act and think differently than what is considered normal. It was like a way of understanding why some people might behave in strange or unusual ways. But now, we use the term clinical psychology to talk about the job of helping people with these kinds of behaviors in a more professional way. It's like when you have a problem and you go see a doctor, but instead of your body, they help you with your thoughts and emotions.
