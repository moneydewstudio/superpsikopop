## What is the definition of anti-positivism according to Psychologists?

anti-positivism is An approach to research that emphasises the human interpretation of meanings and implications; introduced as a challenge to hardline positivism. See qualitative research, hermeneutics.

This way of doing research focuses on how people understand and interpret things. It's different from another way called positivism, which is very strict and only looks at facts. This approach wants to explore what things mean to people and what it can imply or suggest. It's like looking at a story or a piece of art and trying to understand the deeper meaning behind it. To do this kind of research, people use a method called qualitative research, which is about studying things in a detailed and descriptive way. Another term used for this approach is hermeneutics, which is a fancy word that means trying to understand the true meaning of something.

 

## What are the example case of anti-positivism?

1\. "The Positivist Dispute in German Sociology" by Theodor W. Adorno Published in 1969, this research explores the anti-positivist stance adopted by critical theorists against the dominant trend of positivism in sociology during the mid-20th century. Adorno argues against positivism's claims of objectivity and value-neutrality and advocates for a more critical and reflexive approach to social research.

2\. "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Thomas S. Kuhn Published in 1962, this influential research challenges the positivist view of scientific progress as cumulative and linear. Kuhn suggests that scientific revolutions occur when a dominant paradigm is challenged by a new, incompatible paradigm. He argues that scientific progress is better understood as a series of paradigm shifts rather than continuous accumulations of knowledge.

3\. "The Denial of Death" by Ernest Becker Published in 1973, this psychological study explores the ways in which humans construct and defend symbolic frameworks against the existential anxiety caused by the inevitability of death. Becker criticizes positivism for its failure to address the deeper existential questions of human existence and argues for a more holistic and existential approach to psychological research.

4\. "The Blurred Boundaries of Social Science: The Role of Interpretation, Values and Theory" by William Outhwaite Published in 1988, this research examines the limitations of positivism in social science and argues for the importance of interpretation, values, and theory in understanding social phenomena. Outhwaite critiques positivist assumptions of value-neutrality, arguing that researchers' subjectivity and theoretical frameworks shape the research process and outcomes.

5\. "The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture" edited by Hal Foster Published in 1983, this collection of texts discusses the critique of positivism within the context of postmodernism. The various essays explore topics such as the limits of positivist rationality, the importance of subjectivity and cultural context in interpreting art and aesthetics, and the rejection of universalist claims in favor of multiple, partial viewpoints.

These notable researches highlight the critiques and alternative perspectives to positivism, offering insights into the limitations and controversies surrounding the term anti-positivism.
