## What is the definition of attitude according to Psychologists?

attitude is A mental set held by an individual that affects how that person regards events and organises their cognitions. Attitudes are commonly held to have three essential components or dimensions:(i)           a cognitive dimension, involving the beliefs and rationalisations that explain the holding of the attitude;(ii)         an affective dimension, involving the emotional aspects of the attitude, such as likes, dislikes, feelings of distaste or affection; and(iii)        a behavioural dimension that involves the extent to which the individual is prepared to act on the attitude that he or she holds. However, recent approaches also include:(iv)        a conative dimension, concerned with intentionality.attitude scale A quantitative technique for measuring attitudes. Attitude scales can take many forms: one of the most frequently encountered is the Likert scale, which offers an ordinal level of measurement usually indicating preferences; but attitude scales can take other forms as well, such as the semantic differential. The challenge in attitude measurement is in developing scales which can incorporate the affective and conative attitude domains as well as the cognitive.

A mental set is like a way of thinking that a person has that affects how they see things and organize their thoughts. Attitudes are made up of three important parts: (i) what a person believes and how they explain their attitude, (ii) how they feel about it emotionally, and (iii) how likely they are to act on it. But some new ideas also include (iv) how determined they are to follow through on their attitude.

An attitude scale is a way to measure attitudes using numbers. There are many different types of attitude scales, but one common one is called the Likert scale. It asks people to rank their preferences from least to most. The challenge in measuring attitudes is finding a way to include both the emotional and determined parts of attitudes, along with the beliefs and explanations.
