## What is the definition of association cortex according to Psychologists?

association cortex is An older term given to those parts of the cerebral cortex that did not seem to have a specific, localised function. They used to be thought of as the areas in which basic perceptual information is associated with more general knowledge, but modern brain scanning research indicates that there is more localisation of complex cognitive functioning than could have been detected using earlier research methods. See also equipotentiality.

An old word used to describe parts of the brain that scientists didn't understand very well. They used to think that these parts of the brain were where basic information from our senses mixed with our general knowledge, but new research shows that the brain is actually organized in a way that does have specific functions. This new research involved scanning the brain to learn more. Another important term to know is "equipotentiality," which means that different parts of the brain can sometimes do the same job.

 

## What are the example case of association cortex?

1\. Felleman, D. J., & Van Essen, D. C. (1991). Distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex. Cerebral cortex, 1(1), 1-47. This study presents a comprehensive overview of the organization and connectivity of the association cortex in primates, highlighting its role in higher-order cognitive functions.

2\. Barbas, H. (2000). Connections underlying the synthesis of cognition, memory, and emotion in primate prefrontal cortices. Brain research bulletin, 52(5), 319-330. This research focuses on the prefrontal association cortex and its connections with other brain regions, highlighting its involvement in cognition, memory, and emotion.

3\. Mesulam, M. M. (1998). From sensation to cognition. Brain, 121(6), 1013-1052. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the association cortex's role in transforming sensory information into cognitive processes, emphasizing its contribution to perception, attention, and language.

4\. Price, C. J., & Friston, K. J. (2002). Degeneracy and cognitive anatomy. Trends in cognitive sciences, 6(10), 416-421. This research explores the concept of degeneracy in the association cortex, which refers to the ability of different neural circuits to produce flexible and adaptive cognitive functions, shedding light on the complexity of its organization.

5\. Yeo, B. T., Krienen, F. M., Sepulcre, J., Sabuncu, M. R., Lashkari, D., Hollinshead, M., ... & Buckner, R. L. (2011). The organization of the human cerebral cortex estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity. Journal of neurophysiology, 106(3), 1125-1165. This study utilizes functional connectivity analysis to map the organization of the human cerebral cortex, including the association cortex, revealing distinct networks and their potential roles in cognition and behavior.

6\. Vossel, S., Geng, J. J., & Fink, G. R. (2014). Dorsal and ventral attention systems: distinct neural circuits but collaborative roles. The Neuroscientist, 20(2), 150-159. This research investigates the interaction between the dorsal and ventral attention systems, which involve association cortex regions, highlighting their collaborative roles in attentional processes.

7\. Margulies, D. S., Ghosh, S. S., Goulas, A., Falkiewicz, M., Huntenburg, J. M., Langs, G., ... & Schmidt, R. (2016). Situating the default-mode network along a principal gradient of macroscale cortical organization. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113(44), 12574-12579. This study proposes a gradient-based model for cortical organization, positioning the default mode network (a prominent association cortex network) along a principal gradient, shedding light on its functional significance.

These notable researches provide insights into the organization, connectivity, and functional roles of the association cortex, contributing to our understanding of its involvement in a wide range of cognitive processes.

 

## What are other terms related to association cortex?

1\. Prefrontal cortex: The frontmost part of the association cortex responsible for higher cognitive functions, decision-making, and planning.

2\. Temporal lobe: The part of the association cortex located on the sides of the brain, responsible for processing auditory information, memory, and language comprehension.

3\. Parietal lobe: The part of the association cortex located above the temporal lobe, responsible for processing sensory information, spatial awareness, and coordination of movements.

4\. Occipital lobe: The part of the association cortex located at the back of the brain, responsible for processing visual information.

5\. Multimodal association areas: Regions of the association cortex where sensory information from different modalities (such as vision, hearing, and touch) converge to form integrated perceptions and higher-level cognitive functions.

6\. Executive functions: Higher-level cognitive processes controlled by the association cortex, including reasoning, problem-solving, attention, and working memory.

7\. Association fibers: Neural fibers that connect different regions within the association cortex, allowing for communication and integration of information.

8\. Default mode network: A network of brain regions within the association cortex that is most active when the mind is at rest and not focused on the external environment. It is believed to be involved in self-reflection, mind-wandering, and social cognition.

9\. Frontoparietal network: A network of brain regions within the association cortex involved in cognitive control, attention, and shifting between different mental states.

10\. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: A specific region within the prefrontal cortex implicated in decision-making, working memory, and cognitive flexibility.
