## What is the definition of agonist according to Psychologists?

agonist is A drug that causes a neurotransmitter to have an increased effect. For example, it is suspected that cocaine is an agonist for the neurotransmitter dopamine and that is why it produces pleasurable sensations.

A drug is like a substance that can affect how our brain works. Imagine a neurotransmitter as a messenger in our brain that sends important messages. Some drugs can make a specific neurotransmitter become stronger, meaning it can have a bigger impact on our brain.

For instance, cocaine is believed to be a type of drug that makes a neurotransmitter called dopamine work much harder. This is why using cocaine can create feelings of pleasure or enjoyment. It's like the drug is telling the dopamine messenger to work really hard, which can lead to those pleasurable sensations.
