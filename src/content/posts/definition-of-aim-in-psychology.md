## What is the definition of aim according to Psychologists?

aim is The overall purpose of a piece of research or study. The aim can often become obscured or overwhelmed by the details involved in research design and statistical analysis, so it is important for researchers to maintain awareness of the aim throughout the research process.

The main reason why researchers conduct a study or research is called the aim. Sometimes, researchers can get so wrapped up in the specific details and numbers that they lose sight of their main goal. It is crucial for researchers to constantly remind themselves of their aim to ensure they stay focused throughout the research process.
