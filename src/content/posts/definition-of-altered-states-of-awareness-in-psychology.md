> Also known as altered states of consciousness, this term refers to the idea that there are qualitatively different mental states that will result in various psychological processes such as attention and motivation functioning differently. Sleep is an obvious example, but more subtle changes in the waking state have also been studied, including hypnosis and agentic state.

## What is the definition of altered states of awareness according to Psychologists?

altered states of awareness is Also known as altered states of consciousness, this term refers to the idea that there are qualitatively different mental states that will result in various psychological processes such as attention and motivation functioning differently. Sleep is an obvious example, but more subtle changes in the waking state have also been studied, including hypnosis and agentic state.

Altered states of consciousness refers to the concept that our minds can experience different mental states. These states can make our thoughts, focus, and drive work in different ways. One common example is sleep, where our minds are in a different state compared to when we're awake. However, there are also less noticeable changes in our waking state that scientists have studied, like hypnosis and agentic state, where our minds can work differently than usual.

 

## What are the example case of altered states of awareness?

One notable research regarding altered states of awareness is Stanley Krippner's study on psychedelic substances and their effects on consciousness. In the 1960s and 1970s, Krippner conducted extensive research on the use of psychedelic drugs like LSD and psilocybin mushrooms. His work focused on how these substances induced altered states of awareness and their potential therapeutic applications.

Another important research study is the late Charles Tart's work on the scientific exploration of altered states of consciousness. Tart, a psychologist, investigated various techniques such as meditation, hypnosis, and sensory deprivation to induce altered states in research participants. He examined the unique phenomenological experiences associated with these states and explored their implications for understanding consciousness.

Furthermore, the research conducted by Dr. Michael Persinger on the effects of electromagnetic stimulation on consciousness is noteworthy. Persinger created a device called the "God helmet" that applied weak magnetic fields to specific brain regions. He found that these fields could induce altered states of awareness, leading to experiences often described as mystical or spiritual.

Moreover, the work of Dr. Charles Grob regarding altered states of awareness through the use of the psychedelic substance MDMA (commonly known as Ecstasy) is highly significant. Grob conducted pioneering research on MDMA-assisted therapy, demonstrating its potential efficacy in treating conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by promoting emotional openness and reducing fear response.

These studies are just a few examples of the extensive research conducted on altered states of awareness. They have contributed significantly to our understanding of consciousness, its variations, and potential therapeutic applications.
