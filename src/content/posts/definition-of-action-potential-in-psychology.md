## What is the definition of action potential according to Psychologists?

action potential is The electrical impulse produced by a neurone when its stimulation exceeds the threshold level, such that the neurone fires. See also evoked potential.

Imagine your brain and body are like a big electric circuit. Neurons are the tiny cells that make up this circuit, and they help transmit information from one part of the body to the brain or between different parts of the brain.

Now, when a neuron gets stimulated or excited, it creates an electrical impulse. It's like a spark or a little burst of energy that travels along the neuron. But not every little stimulation will cause this electrical impulse.

Think of it like a threshold or a limit. The neuron has a certain level of stimulation that it needs to reach before it can send out this electric impulse. If the stimulation is below that level, nothing happens. It's like having a switch that needs to be pressed hard enough to turn on the lights.

But once the stimulation goes past that threshold level, it's like pressing the switch hard enough. The neuron "fires" and the electrical impulse is sent along to the next neuron or to the brain. It's like turning on the lights when the switch is pushed enough.

This firing is a crucial part of how information is transmitted in your body and brain. It helps different parts communicate with each other and allows you to move, feel, think, and do all sorts of things. So, when we talk about an electrical impulse firing in a neuron, it means that it got stimulated enough to send a spark of information through the circuit.

 

## What are the example case of action potential?

One of the most important and notable research studies regarding the term "action potential" was conducted by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Fielding Huxley, known as the Hodgkin-Huxley experiments, which led to the understanding of the fundamental mechanism behind the generation and propagation of action potentials.

In the 1950s, Hodgkin and Huxley performed a series of groundbreaking experiments on the giant axons of squids to investigate how nerve impulses were generated and conducted. These experiments involved inserting microelectrodes into the axons, measuring voltage changes, and manipulating the ionic concentrations.

Their research demonstrated that the action potential was primarily driven by the movement of ions across the cell membrane. They described the concept of voltage-gated ion channels, which open or close depending on the membrane potential, controlling the flow of sodium and potassium ions.

Hodgkin and Huxley developed a mathematical model called the Hodgkin-Huxley model to describe the kinetics of ion channels and their contributions to the action potential. This model became a foundation for understanding the electrical properties of nerve cells and paved the way for future research in neuroscience.

For this groundbreaking work, Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963, providing a significant advancement in our understanding of action potentials and their role in neural communication.

 

## What are other terms related to action potential?

Resting Membrane Potential: Neurons and muscle cells have a resting membrane potential, which is a stable voltage across the cell membrane when the cell is not actively transmitting signals. This potential is maintained by ion channels and pumps.

Depolarization: When a stimulus reaches a certain threshold, it triggers the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels. Sodium ions (Na+) rush into the cell, causing a rapid change in membrane potential from negative to positive. This phase is known as depolarization.

Peak: The point at which the membrane potential reaches its maximum positive value.

Repolarization: After depolarization, voltage-gated potassium channels open, allowing potassium ions (K+) to exit the cell. This results in a return to a negative membrane potential, known as repolarization.

Hyperpolarization: In some cases, the membrane potential may briefly become more negative than the resting potential, known as hyperpolarization.

Refractory Period: Following an action potential, there is a brief period during which the cell is less responsive to additional stimuli. This is called the refractory period.

Propagation: Action potentials can propagate along the length of an axon, allowing for the transmission of signals between neurons.
