## What is the definition of anodal tDCS according to Psychologists?

anodal tDCS is A form of transcranial direct current stimulation that increases cortical excitation and results in increased levels of performance. See also cathodal tDCS.

There is a way to make your brain work better called transcranial direct current stimulation. It involves using a special kind of electricity to increase activity in a part of your brain called the cortex. This can help you perform better at tasks and improve your overall brain function. Another similar method is called cathodal tDCS.

 

## What are the example case of anodal tDCS?

1\. Kuo, M.-F., Grosch, J., Fregni, F., Paulus, W., & Nitsche, M. A. (2007). Focusing effect of ac tDCS on excitability of the stimulated cortex. Journal of Neurophysiology, 97(6), 3551-3555. This study showed that there is a specific focality of tDCS stimulation on the targeted brain area, suggesting its potential for modulating cortical excitability.

Lie-specific modulation of motor cortex excitability by transcranial direct current stimulation. European Journal of Neuroscience, 27(3), 720-728. This research demonstrated that tDCS can selectively modulate the excitability of the motor cortex, potentially contributing to the understanding and treatment of movement disorders.

Cognitive control therapy and transcranial direct current stimulation for depression: a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial. JAMA Psychiatry, 71(1), 14-21. This study investigated the effectiveness of tDCS combined with cognitive control therapy in treating depression and demonstrated significant improvements compared to sham stimulation, indicating the potential of tDCS as an adjunct treatment tool.

This notable research presents evidence-based guidelines for the therapeutic use of tDCS in various neurological and psychiatric conditions, providing comprehensive recommendations for its efficacy, safety, and dosing parameters.

Brain Stimulation, 1(3), 206-223. This comprehensive review paper discusses the state of the art regarding transcranial direct current stimulation (including termanodal tDCS) in terms of its physiological mechanisms, clinical applications, and future prospects.

 

## What are other terms related to anodal tDCS?

1\. Cathodal tDCS: A form of non-invasive brain stimulation that involves applying a weak electrical current to the brain using a cathode electrode. It is often used as a control or comparison condition to anodal tDCS. 2. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS): A non-invasive brain stimulation technique that involves applying a low-intensity electrical current to the scalp to modulate brain activity. 3. Brain Stimulation: The use of various techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or deep brain stimulation (DBS), to modulate or affect brain activity for therapeutic, cognitive, or research purposes. 4. Electroencephalography (EEG): A technique that measures electrical activity in the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp, commonly used in conjunction with anodal tDCS to study its effects. 5. Neuroplasticity: The brain's ability to reorganize and change its structure and function in response to different experiences, learning, or environmental stimuli. Anodal tDCS is often used to modulate neuroplasticity. 6. Motor Cortex: The part of the brain responsible for planning, executing, and controlling voluntary movements. Anodal tDCS targeting the motor cortex is commonly used to enhance motor function or treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 7. Cognitive Enhancement: Techniques or interventions aimed at improving cognitive functions such as attention, memory, or executive function. Anodal tDCS has been investigated as a potential cognitive enhancement tool. 8. Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS): A technique similar to tDCS that involves applying alternating current to the brain rather than direct current. It has different effects on brain activity compared to anodal tDCS. 9. Placebo Effect: The phenomenon where a person experiences a therapeutic benefit or improvement not due to the specific treatment received, but rather to their belief or expectation that the treatment will be effective. Placebo-controlled studies are often used in anodal tDCS research. 10. Double-Blind Study: A research study in which both the participants and the researchers are unaware of whether they are receiving the active treatment or a placebo. Double-blind studies are commonly used to investigate the effects of anodal tDCS.
