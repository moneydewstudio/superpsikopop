## What is the definition of according to Psychologists?


## What are the example case of ?

1\. The Stanford Prison Experiment: This famous study conducted in 1971 by psychologist Philip Zimbardo aimed to investigate the psychological effects of perceived power and authority. The study involved randomly assigning participants to the roles of guards and prisoners in a simulated prison environment and revealed the strong impact of situational factors on human behavior.

2\. The Milgram Experiment: Conducted by Stanley Milgram in the early 1960s, this study aimed to understand people's obedience to authority figures, even when instructed to harm others. Participants were led to believe they were administering electric shocks to another person, and the experiment demonstrated how ordinary individuals could be influenced to commit questionable actions under certain circumstances.

3\. Harlow's Monkey Experiments: Carried out by Harry Harlow in the late 1950s, these experiments explored the effects of maternal deprivation on infant monkeys. Harlow separated infant monkeys from their mothers and provided them with two surrogate "mothers": one made of wire and one made of soft cloth. This research helped shape our understanding of the importance of touch and social interaction in early child development.

4\. Asch Conformity Experiments: Conducted by Solomon Asch in the 1950s, these studies aimed to understand conformity and social influence. Participants were asked to judge the lengths of lines in a group setting, and the study revealed the power of group pressure to influence individual decision-making, even when the group consensus was clearly incorrect.

5\. The Bobo Doll Experiment: Conducted by Albert Bandura in 1961, this study examined the impact of observing aggressive behavior on children's behavior. Children who observed an adult model displaying aggressive behavior towards an inflatable doll were more likely to imitate the aggressive actions. This research highlighted the role of observational learning and the influence of social models on behavior.

6\. The Marshmallow Test: Conducted by Walter Mischel in the 1960s and 1970s, this study examined the ability of young children to delay gratification. Children were offered a choice between receiving a small reward immediately or waiting for a larger reward. The longitudinal research found that children who displayed greater self-control in the experiment went on to achieve better outcomes in various areas of life, emphasizing the importance of self-regulation.

7\. The Stanford Marshmallow Experiment Revisited: In a more recent follow-up study to the original marshmallow test, a team of researchers led by Tyler Watts, Greg Duncan, and Haonan Quan re-evaluated the long-term effects of delayed gratification. The researchers found that self-control in childhood was a better predictor of behavior and success later in life than previously thought, with implications for education and parenting strategies.

These are just a few notable research studies related to different aspects of human behavior, psychology, and social influence. There are numerous other important studies that have contributed to our understanding of the term term, each bringing unique insights into various areas of human behavior and cognition.
