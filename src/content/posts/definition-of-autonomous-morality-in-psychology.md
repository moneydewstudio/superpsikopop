> The third of Kohlbergs three levels of moral development, in which the individual is considered to have reached a point where he or she arrives at moral judgements and decisions on the basis of his or her own reasoning, rather than simply by accepting the ideas laid down by society. In the first stage of this level, the person accepts social rules and moral codes because he or she considers them to have been democratically established for the common good. In the second stage, a more individual judgement is achieved, and the person may eventually come to reject some commonly accepted social values that they feel to be unjust or immoral.

## What is the definition of autonomous morality according to Psychologists?

autonomous morality is The third of Kohlbergs three levels of moral development, in which the individual is considered to have reached a point where he or she arrives at moral judgements and decisions on the basis of his or her own reasoning, rather than simply by accepting the ideas laid down by society. In the first stage of this level, the person accepts social rules and moral codes because he or she considers them to have been democratically established for the common good. In the second stage, a more individual judgement is achieved, and the person may eventually come to reject some commonly accepted social values that they feel to be unjust or immoral.

Kohlberg's third level of moral development is like climbing a ladder. In this level, people make decisions about right and wrong based on their own thinking, instead of just following what others say.

At the first stage of this level, people follow rules and moral codes because they think they were made fairly for everyone's benefit. It's like joining a club and agreeing to follow the club's rules because they were decided together.

In the second stage, people start to think for themselves and may disagree with some rules that they feel are not fair or wrong. It's like deciding that some of the club's rules don't make sense and speaking up about it. They want fairness and justice for everyone, not just blindly following what others say is right.
