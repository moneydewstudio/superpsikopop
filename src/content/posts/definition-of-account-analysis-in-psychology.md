> A research method that involves analysing the accounts that people give of their experience. Developed in answer to the need for psychological research techniques that could deal with the subjective realities of human experience (as opposed to measures of behaviour), account analysis takes as its starting point the radical idea that what people say may have meaning. From there, it goes on to assert that a systematic approach to collecting peoples own versions of an experience or event may be of value to psychologists seeking to understand human experience.

## What is the definition of account analysis according to Psychologists?

account analysis is A research method that involves analysing the accounts that people give of their experience. Developed in answer to the need for psychological research techniques that could deal with the subjective realities of human experience (as opposed to measures of behaviour), account analysis takes as its starting point the radical idea that what people say may have meaning. From there, it goes on to assert that a systematic approach to collecting peoples own versions of an experience or event may be of value to psychologists seeking to understand human experience.

Account analysis is a way for psychologists to understand how people experience things by listening to what they say about their experiences. Instead of just looking at how people behave, account analysis focuses on the thoughts and feelings that people share about what they have gone through. It starts with the idea that what people say can be important and meaningful. By collecting and studying people's own descriptions of events or experiences, psychologists can learn more about how humans understand and interpret their world.
