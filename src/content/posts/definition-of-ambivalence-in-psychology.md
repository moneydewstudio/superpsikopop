## What is the definition of ambivalence according to Psychologists?

ambivalence is The simultaneous existence of two opposed emotions, motivations or attitudes (e.g. lovehate, approachavoidance). Each feeling has its own separate origin, so the two cannot be reconciled, and the person either alternates between the two attitudes or represses one of them.

Doublethink is when a person feels two opposite things at the same time. For example, someone might feel both love and hate for someone or something. These feelings come from different places, so they can't really be resolved. Because of this, the person might switch back and forth between the two feelings or ignore one of them.
