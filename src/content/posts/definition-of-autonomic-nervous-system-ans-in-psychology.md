> A network of unmyelinated nerve fibres running from the brainstem and spinal cord to the internal organs, which can activate the body rapidly, preparing it for action. The ANS has two main parts, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic divisions. Activation of the sympathetic division results in the body being rapidly prepared for action, producing the alarm reaction. It is strongly involved in active emotions such as excitement, fear or anger. Activation of the parasympathetic division involves more quiescent functioning such as digestion, tissue growth and repair, the storage of blood sugars and the building up of bodily reserves. The parasympathetic division is thought to be involved in the passive emotions such as depression, contentment or sadness. There seem to be individual differences in the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic arousal, and in the overall lability (see labile) of the autonomic nervous system (see Figure 7).

## What is the definition of autonomic nervous system (ANS) according to Psychologists?

autonomic nervous system (ANS) is A network of unmyelinated nerve fibres running from the brainstem and spinal cord to the internal organs, which can activate the body rapidly, preparing it for action. The ANS has two main parts, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic divisions. Activation of the sympathetic division results in the body being rapidly prepared for action, producing the alarm reaction. It is strongly involved in active emotions such as excitement, fear or anger. Activation of the parasympathetic division involves more quiescent functioning such as digestion, tissue growth and repair, the storage of blood sugars and the building up of bodily reserves. The parasympathetic division is thought to be involved in the passive emotions such as depression, contentment or sadness. There seem to be individual differences in the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic arousal, and in the overall lability (see labile) of the autonomic nervous system (see Figure 7).

The autonomic nervous system is like a network of nerves that go from your brain and spine to your organs inside your body. It helps your body get ready to do things quickly. There are two main parts of the autonomic nervous system: the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.

When the sympathetic division is activated, your body gets ready to take action really fast. This can happen when you feel excited, scared, or angry. It's like your body goes into "alarm mode" to help you react.

On the other hand, when the parasympathetic division is activated, your body functions in a more calm and relaxed way. It helps with things like digestion, growing and fixing tissues, storing energy, and building up reserves in your body. This division is linked to emotions like feeling sad, content, or even depressed.

Different people have different levels of activity in their sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Some people may have a good balance between the two, while others may have more activity in one division than the other. This can affect how easily the autonomic nervous system reacts to things happening around you.
