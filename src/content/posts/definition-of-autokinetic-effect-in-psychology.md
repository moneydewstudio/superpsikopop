## What is the definition of autokinetic effect according to Psychologists?

autokinetic effect is A visual illusion involving the apparent motion of a stationary dot of light when it is perceived in a totally dark environment. The light appears to move in rapid jerks, because of the minute tremors made by the eyeball.

Imagine you are in a really dark room with no light at all except for a little dot that you see in the room. Even though the dot is actually not moving, it looks like it's moving really fast and making little jumps. This happens because our eyes have tiny movements that we can't control, and those movements make the dot seem like it's moving.
