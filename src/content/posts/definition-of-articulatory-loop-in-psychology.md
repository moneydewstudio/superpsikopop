## What is the definition of articulatory loop according to Psychologists?

articulatory loop is The part of Baddeleys model of working memory that performs rehearsal of information held for short periods of time. The articulatory loop is where incoming information is rehearsed in order to retain its immediacy, and therefore its availability for information processing.

In Baddeley's model of working memory, there is a part called the articulatory loop, which helps us remember things for a short time. It's like a little voice inside our head that repeats the information we just heard or saw. This helps us keep the information fresh in our minds so that we can use it right away.

 

## What are the example case of articulatory loop?

1\. Baddeley, A. D., & Hitch, G. J. (1974). Working memory. The psychology of learning and motivation, 8, 47-89. This influential paper by Baddeley and Hitch introduced the concept of the articulatory loop as a component of working memory. They proposed that verbal information is temporarily stored in a phonological buffer, called the articulatory loop, which involves the subvocal rehearsal of speech sounds.

2\. Baddeley, A. D., & Lewis, V. J. (1981). Inner active processing in reading: Implications for theories of reading disability. Neuropsychologia, 19(5), 357-369. This research examined how the articulatory loop is involved in reading. It suggested that individuals with reading disabilities may have difficulties with the phonological loop, leading to reading impairments.

3\. Smith, E. E., Jonides, J., & Koeppe, R. A. (1996). Dissociating verbal and spatial working memory using PET. Cerebral cortex, 6(1), 11-20. This study used PET scanning to investigate the neural substrates of verbal working memory, including the articulatory loop. It provided neuroimaging evidence supporting the separability of verbal and spatial working memory systems.

4\. Smith, E. E., & Jonides, J. (1999). Storage and executive processes in the frontal lobes. Science, 283(5408), 1657-1661. This research explored the role of the articulatory loop within the broader framework of working memory and executive functions. It highlighted the involvement of the frontal lobes in articulatory rehearsal and other higher-order cognitive processes.

5\. Majerus, S., Sally, S., Péters, F., Vaessen, A., & Poncelet, M. (2006). Mapping the short-term memory verbal store: insights from neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies. Psyche, 12(2), 14-21. This review paper examined multiple studies investigating the articulatory loop and its role in verbal short-term memory. It discussed the findings from neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underlying the articulatory loop.

These notable research papers have significantly advanced our understanding of the term "articulatory loop" and its role in working memory, reading disabilities, neural activation, and cognitive processes.

 

## What are other terms related to articulatory loop?

1\. Articulatory rehearsal loop: Also known as the phonological loop, it is a component of working memory responsible for the temporary storage and manipulation of verbal information.

2\. Subvocalization: The internal speech or silent vocalization that occurs when reading or mentally rehearsing written or spoken information.

3\. Inner voice: The internal speech or inner monologue that individuals use to think, reason, or rehearse information without speaking out loud.

4\. Auditory imagery: The mental representation or perception of sound, including imagined sounds or voices.

5\. Repetition priming: The phenomenon where prior exposure to a stimulus enhances the individual's ability to process or recognize that stimulus later on.

6\. Speech production: The process by which individuals generate the spoken form of language, involving the coordination of various articulatory organs.

7\. Working memory: The cognitive system responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information during cognitive tasks.

8\. Phonological store: A component of the articulatory loop responsible for the temporary storage of verbal material, such as spoken or written words.

9\. Flashbulb memory: A vivid, detailed, and long-lasting memory of a specific event, often triggered by an emotional or significant event.

10\. Verbal working memory: The subset of working memory specifically focused on the temporary storage and manipulation of verbal information.
