> An approach to psychological enquiry that challenges the idealised view of the psychologist as an objective scientist, standing apart from the subject matter and observing it dispassionately. Action research takes as its starting point the idea that the presence of other people will always affect behaviour, so it is naïve to assume that the activities of the researcher will not influence the behaviour of the subject. Instead, an action researcher deliberately acts as a change agent within a given situation and incorporates the effects of these actions as an integral part of the outcome of the research. Initially developed in an organisational context by Lewin (e.g. Lewin, 1946), action research has continued to be popular in organisational psychology. With the increased emphasis on ecological validity in psychological research, action research has gradually gained acceptance in several other areas of psychological investigation. See also new paradigm research, participant observation.

## What is the definition of action research according to Psychologists?

action research is An approach to psychological enquiry that challenges the idealised view of the psychologist as an objective scientist, standing apart from the subject matter and observing it dispassionately. Action research takes as its starting point the idea that the presence of other people will always affect behaviour, so it is naïve to assume that the activities of the researcher will not influence the behaviour of the subject. Instead, an action researcher deliberately acts as a change agent within a given situation and incorporates the effects of these actions as an integral part of the outcome of the research.

With the increased emphasis on ecological validity in psychological research, action research has gradually gained acceptance in several other areas of psychological investigation.

Action research is a type of psychological investigation that challenges the idea that scientists are always objective and distant from what they're studying. Instead, action researchers believe that the presence of other people always influences behavior, so it's not realistic to assume that a researcher's actions won't affect the subject's behavior. Action researchers purposely act as agents of change within a situation and consider the impact of their actions as part of the research. It was first developed in an organizational context by Lewin and is commonly used in organizational psychology. But now it is also being accepted in other areas of psychological investigation that value real-world relevance. It's a way for researchers to actively participate and observe at the same time.

 

## What are the example case of action research?

One of the most notable research studies on action research is "Action Research: A Guide for the Teacher Researcher" by Geoffrey E. Mills. Published in 2014, this book provides a comprehensive guide for teachers and educational practitioners interested in conducting action research in their classrooms or schools. It offers practical steps, examples, and frameworks for conducting action research and highlights the importance of teacher reflection and collaboration in improving educational practices.

Another important research paper is "Action Research in Education: A Conceptual Framework" by Ewald Terhart, published in 2011. This paper presents a conceptual framework for understanding action research in educational settings. It discusses the various research approaches, including participatory action research, collaborative action research, and self-study, and examines their different stages and characteristics in the context of education. It offers educators a theoretical foundation for conducting action research and highlights its potential for driving change and improvement in educational practice.

Additionally, the action research conducted by Kurt Lewin, a pioneer in social psychology, is highly influential in understanding the concept. Lewin's research in the 1940s and 1950s laid the foundation for action research and emphasized the importance of collaboration and active participation in problem-solving. He developed a three-step model of action research, known as "planning, action, and reflection," which has been widely adopted and adapted by researchers and practitioners in various fields.

These are just a few of the many notable contributions to the field of action research. The concept has been extensively explored and researched within different disciplines, including education, social sciences, and organizational development, and continues to evolve as a valuable approach to understanding and addressing complex problems in various contexts.

 

## What are other terms related to action research?

Identifying a Problem or Issue: The process begins with the identification of a specific problem or issue within the organization or community that requires attention or improvement.

Planning: Researchers work collaboratively with practitioners to plan interventions or actions that can address the identified problem. This phase involves setting goals, determining strategies, and outlining the research process.

Acting: The planned interventions or actions are implemented in the real-world setting. This phase involves carrying out the changes or strategies identified in the planning stage.

Observing: Researchers and practitioners systematically observe and collect data on the effects of the implemented actions. This data collection can involve various methods such as surveys, interviews, observations, or quantitative measurements.

Reflecting: Stakeholders reflect on the observed outcomes and the effectiveness of the interventions. This reflective process often involves considering what worked well, what didn't, and what adjustments might be needed.

Replanning: Based on the reflections and observations, stakeholders collaboratively revise and refine the action plan. This may involve making adjustments to strategies, setting new goals, or considering alternative approaches.

Implementing Changes: The revised plan is implemented, and the cycle continues. Action research is an iterative process that allows for continuous improvement based on ongoing reflection and feedback.
