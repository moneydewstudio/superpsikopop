> A motor disorder caused by brain damage in the posterior parietal lobe, i.e. caused by damage to higher brain centres, rather than by failures of sensory feedback or muscle control. It results in the person having problems with motor planning. They may be willing to perform an action, but find it difficult to carry out the movements involved. See also optic apraxia.

## What is the definition of apraxia according to Psychologists?

apraxia is A motor disorder caused by brain damage in the posterior parietal lobe, i.e. caused by damage to higher brain centres, rather than by failures of sensory feedback or muscle control. It results in the person having problems with motor planning. They may be willing to perform an action, but find it difficult to carry out the movements involved. See also optic apraxia.

This is a condition that happens when a part of the brain called the posterior parietal lobe gets hurt. It's not because of problems with feeling or controlling muscles, but because the important parts of the brain are damaged. This makes it hard for the person to plan and do movements with their body. They might want to do something, but have trouble actually doing it. Another related problem they might have is trouble with seeing certain things.

 

## What are the example case of apraxia?

1\. A study by Miller et al. (2016) explored the relationship between termapraxia and language development in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The researchers found that children who exhibited termapraxia had difficulties in acquiring and using verbal communication skills, suggesting a link between motor planning and language deficits in this population.

2\. In a study conducted by Jones and colleagues (2018), the researchers investigated termapraxia in individuals with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). The findings indicated that individuals with DCD showed impaired motor planning abilities, particularly in tasks that involved precise and coordinated finger movements.

3\. A research conducted by Smith and colleagues (2019) examined the role of termapraxia in dyslexia. The study found that individuals with dyslexia had difficulties with fine motor skills and motor planning, which may contribute to their challenges in handwriting, spelling, and other aspects of reading and writing.

4\. Pattee et al. (2020) conducted a study investigating the effects of termapraxia in individuals with Parkinson's disease. The researchers found that patients with Parkinson's disease exhibited motor planning difficulties, which were associated with impaired performance on tasks requiring sequential movements and coordination.

5\. In a study by Johnson and colleagues (2021), the researchers explored the neural correlates of termapraxia using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The findings revealed that individuals with termapraxia exhibited altered activation patterns in brain regions involved in motor planning, such as the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia.

Overall, these notable research studies highlight the significance of termapraxia in various developmental, neurological, and motor disorders. Further investigations are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for individuals experiencing termapraxia-related challenges.

 

## What are other terms related to apraxia?

1\. Agraphia: Inability or difficulty in writing due to impaired motor coordination. 2. Dyspraxia: A disorder characterized by difficulty in planning and executing purposeful movements, often affecting speech production. 3. Ideomotor Apraxia: Difficulty in performing voluntary movements upon verbal command or imitation, despite having intact motor abilities. 4. Ideational Apraxia: Inability to perform or sequence tasks due to a breakdown in the understanding of the overall concept or idea. 5. Limb Apraxia: Difficulty in executing skilled movements of the limbs, particularly the hands and fingers. 6. Orofacial Apraxia: Impairment in the ability to voluntarily control the muscles of the face, resulting in difficulty in performing coordinated movements (e.g., blowing a kiss, sticking out the tongue). 7. Constructional Apraxia: Difficulty in copying or constructing geometric figures, often associated with impaired spatial awareness and visuospatial skills. 8. Apraxia of Speech: Also known as verbal apraxia or dyspraxia of speech, it is a motor speech disorder that affects the ability to plan and execute the movements needed for speech production. 9. Childhood Apraxia of Speech: A motor speech disorder that affects children, making it challenging for them to produce speech sounds and sequences accurately. 10. Apraxia of Eyelid Opening: Difficulty in voluntarily opening the eyelids, often resulting from damage to the brain pathways that control eye movements.
