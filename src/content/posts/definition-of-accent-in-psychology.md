> A distinctive pattern of pronouncing words and phrases that is shared by members of a social or regional group. In some circumstances, accent is taken as an important signifier of social status, and may thus determine the nature of social interaction between individuals. This was particularly noticeable in stratified societies such as that of the UK in the twentieth century but is gradually being eroded as regional accents become more common in the media.

## What is the definition of accent according to Psychologists?

accent is A distinctive pattern of pronouncing words and phrases that is shared by members of a social or regional group. In some circumstances, accent is taken as an important signifier of social status, and may thus determine the nature of social interaction between individuals. This was particularly noticeable in stratified societies such as that of the UK in the twentieth century but is gradually being eroded as regional accents become more common in the media. See also dialect, psycholinguistics, speech register.

Accent refers to the way people from different places or groups talk. It's like their own special way of pronouncing words. Sometimes, people think having a certain accent makes them seem important or higher in society. So, the way they speak can affect how others treat them and interact with them. This was especially true in the past in places like the UK, where people with a certain accent would be treated differently based on their social status. But nowadays, with the spread of regional accents through things like TV and movies, the importance of accents in determining social interactions is starting to lessen. Accent is also related to dialect, which is a whole language variety used by a certain group, and psycholinguistics, which is the study of how the mind processes language. Speech register is another related term that refers to the style or formality of speech.
