## What is the definition of ambulatory self-report according to Psychologists?

ambulatory self-report is A form of ambulatory assessment in which the person keeps a record of how they are feeling or other clinical data at various points during the course of their day. See also Ecological Momentary Assessment, diary method.

A way of learning about someone's feelings or health throughout the day. The person keeps a record of how they are doing at different times. It's like keeping a diary to track how they feel or any important information about their health.

 

## What are the example case of ambulatory self-report?

One of the most notable research studies regarding the Ames room is called "The Ames Demonstrations in Perception" (1934) by Adelbert Ames Jr. This research paper described the construction and principles behind the Ames room, as well as its effect on visual perception.

In this study, Ames constructed a peculiar room that appeared to be a trapezoidal shape when viewed from one particular angle. However, when a person entered the room and moved to a specific spot, the room's true distorted shape became apparent. This led to the perception that individuals of different sizes in the room appeared to shrink or grow relative to each other.

The Ames room experiment highlighted the role of visual cues, lighting, and perspective in influencing how humans perceive and interpret spatial dimensions and object size. It demonstrated that our visual system primarily relies on depth cues and relative size to construct a coherent perception of the world around us.

This influential research on the Ames room contributes to our understanding of visual perception and has been used to study various aspects of perception, including depth perception, size constancy, and visual illusion. The findings have had implications in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and computer vision.

 

## What are other terms related to ambulatory self-report?

1\. Ambulatory self-report: A method of collecting data or information from individuals by self-reporting their experiences, behaviors, or symptoms in real-time, typically done in an ambulatory or non-clinical setting.

2\. Mobile health apps: Smartphone applications or software that allow individuals to track and monitor their health behaviors, symptoms, or experiences in real-time through self-reporting.

3\. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA): A research method that involves collecting real-time data from individuals in naturalistic settings, typically through the use of mobile devices or electronic diaries, to understand their experiences, behaviors, or symptoms as they occur in their everyday lives.

4\. Daily diary study: A research design where individuals record their experiences, behaviors, or symptoms on a daily basis, typically using paper or electronic diaries, providing a longitudinal perspective on their well-being or health outcomes.

5\. Experience sampling method (ESM): A research technique that involves randomly prompting individuals to report their current experiences, perceptions, or behaviors multiple times a day, often through wearable devices or mobile apps, to gain insights into their moment-to-moment fluctuations in psychological or physical states.
