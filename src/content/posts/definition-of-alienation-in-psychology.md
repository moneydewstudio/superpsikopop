## What is the definition of alienation according to Psychologists?

alienation is A state of feeling or perceiving oneself as separated from: (i) ones own feelings; or (ii) other people and society.

Feeling disconnected from either your own emotions, or from other people and society as a whole.

 

## What are the example case of alienation?

Here are a few notable research studies that have explored the concept of alienation:

1\. "The Division of Labor in Society" (1893) by Émile Durkheim: Durkheim examined how the division of labor in society leads to feelings of alienation among individuals. He argued that when individuals are assigned very narrow and repetitive tasks, they can feel disconnected from the larger social structure.

2\. "The Psychology of Alienation" (1958) by Melvin Seeman: Seeman developed a multidimensional measure of alienation, which included five dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, self-estrangement, and social isolation. This study provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the different aspects of alienation.

3\. "The Society of the Spectacle" (1967) by Guy Debord: Debord analyzed the concept of alienation in modern society through the lens of the "spectacle." He argued that the constant exposure to images, media, and consumer culture leads to individuals becoming passive consumers rather than active participants in shaping their own lives.

4\. "The Corrosion of Character" (1998) by Richard Sennett: Sennett explored how changes in the nature of work have contributed to alienation and the erosion of character in modern society. He discussed the impact of increasing instability, shorter-term employment, and the loss of a sense of pride and identity in one's work.

5\. "The Impact of Job Insecurity on Psychological Well-being" (1997) by De Witte, De Cuyper, and Handaja: This study investigated the relationship between job insecurity and various dimensions of psychological well-being, including alienation. The findings indicated that higher levels of job insecurity were associated with increased feelings of alienation.

These studies offer different perspectives on alienation, considering various contexts such as social structure, work, society, and individual well-being. Further research on the concept continues to explore how alienation manifests in different domains and its implications for individuals and society.
