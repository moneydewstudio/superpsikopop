## What is the definition of anomia according to Psychologists?

anomia is A type of aphasia where the person has consistent difficulties in producing the names of things they want to talk about.

There's a condition called aphasía where some people have trouble saying the names of things they want to talk about. This type of aphasia, called anomia, is when a person consistently struggles to find the right words for certain things. So, imagine trying to describe something but you can't remember what it's called, it can be frustrating. But don't worry, there are ways to help people with anomia find the words they're looking for!
