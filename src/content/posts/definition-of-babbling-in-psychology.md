## What is the definition of babbling according to Psychologists?

babbling is Vocalisation produced by infants, which includes the full range of human phonemes. In his book Verbal Behaviour, B.F. Skinner argued that language acquisition occurred as a result of behaviour shaping, with infant babbling as the operants, conditioned through the Law of Effect.

When babies make different sounds with their mouths, like "goo goo" or "ga ga," it's called babbling. Babbling is important because it helps babies learn how to talk and make all the different sounds that people can make. A famous psychologist named B.F. Skinner believed that babies learn language by practicing their babbling sounds and getting rewarded for making the right ones. So, when a baby says a sound that sounds like a real word, like "ma ma" or "da da," they get a positive reaction from their parents, and this encourages them to keep trying and learning more words.
