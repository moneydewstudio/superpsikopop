## What is the definition of average according to Psychologists?

average is An everyday term used to describe a statistical measure of central tendency, normally the arithmetic mean.

An everyday term used to describe a statistical measure of central tendency is simply a way to show what the regular or typical number is in a group of numbers. This is usually found by adding up all the numbers and then dividing that sum by how many numbers there are.

 

## What are the example case of average?

 

## What are other terms related to average?

1\. Mean: The arithmetic average of a set of numbers, calculated by adding up all the numbers and dividing by the total count.

2\. Median: The middle value of a set of numbers when they are arranged in ascending or descending order. It represents the midpoint of a distribution.

3\. Mode: The value that appears most frequently in a set of numbers. There can be multiple modes in a dataset or no mode at all.

4\. Range: The difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It provides an indication of the spread or variability of the data.

5\. Standard deviation: A measure of how spread out the values in a dataset are from the mean. It quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in the data.

6\. Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean. It provides a measure of how much the data values deviate from the mean.

7\. Quartiles: Values that divide a dataset into four equal parts, each containing 25% of the data. The quartiles are useful for analyzing the distribution of data or detecting outliers.

8\. Interquartile Range (IQR): The range between the first and third quartiles. It gives an indication of the spread of the middle 50% of the data, excluding outliers.

9\. Weighted average: An average calculated by assigning different weights to different values in a dataset. It is often used when the values have different levels of importance or significance.

10\. Geometric mean: The average of a set of numbers calculated by taking the nth root of the product of the numbers, where n is the number of values. It is commonly used for calculating growth rates or ratios.
