## What is the definition of avatar according to Psychologists?

avatar is A fictional representation of a character, such as is used in computer gaming to represent the player.

In computer games, there is a cool thing called a character. It's like a pretend version of yourself that you control in the game. This character can be someone completely made up, like a superhero or a wizard, or it can look like a real person.

Think of it like this: when you play a game with your friends, you might choose to be a specific character, like a princess or a brave knight. You get to decide how your character looks, what they wear, and how they act. In computer games, it's the same idea, but you use a computer to create and control your character.

This character shows up on the screen and moves around as you press buttons or move the joystick. You can make them run, jump, or do all sorts of fun stuff. They can also interact with other characters in the game, like talking to them or fighting with them.

So, a fictional representation of a character in gaming means a pretend person or creature that you get to play as in a computer game. It's like being an actor in a movie, but instead, you're the star of a virtual adventure!
