> A term used to describe the series of physiological responses brought about by the activation of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. Investigated systematically by W. Cannon, thealarm reaction involves, among other changes, increased heart rate and blood pressure, producing an increased supply of oxygen to the muscles, changes to the digestive system, including rapid digestion of sugars for increased energy, and alterations in the composition of the blood such that clotting occurs more quickly. The effective result of these changes is that the body is prepared for extended and demanding effort.

## What is the definition of alarm reaction according to Psychologists?

alarm reaction is A term used to describe the series of physiological responses brought about by the activation of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. Investigated systematically by W. Cannon, thealarm reaction involves, among other changes, increased heart rate and blood pressure, producing an increased supply of oxygen to the muscles, changes to the digestive system, including rapid digestion of sugars for increased energy, and alterations in the composition of the blood such that clotting occurs more quickly. The effective result of these changes is that the body is prepared for extended and demanding effort.

The term "alarm reaction" is used to describe how our body responds when we get scared or stressed. This response is controlled by a part of our nervous system called the sympathetic division. A scientist named W. Cannon studied this reaction and found that it involves several changes in our body.

One change is that our heart rate and blood pressure increase. This helps more oxygen reach our muscles, giving them more energy. Our digestive system also goes through changes, like breaking down sugars quickly to give us more energy. The blood composition changes too, making it easier for our blood to clot if we get hurt.

All of these changes prepare our body for situations where we need to use a lot of energy and effort.

 

## What are the example case of alarm reaction?

One of the most important and notable research studies in the field of alarm reaction and stress response is the work done by Hans Selye, who is often considered the father of stress research.

In 1936, Selye published a paper titled "A Syndrome Produced by Diverse Nocuous Agents." In this study, he introduced the concept of the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS), which refers to the physiological response to stressors. Selye observed that different stressors, whether physical or psychological, trigger a common stress response in the body. He identified three stages of GAS: the alarm reaction, the resistance stage, and the exhaustion stage.

The alarm reaction is the initial stage of the stress response. During this phase, the body perceives a stressor and activates the fight-or-flight response. This includes the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, increased heart rate, and heightened mental alertness.

Selye's research laid the foundation for understanding the physiological and psychological responses to stress, and it brought attention to the detrimental effects of chronic stress on health. His work has had a significant impact on numerous fields, including psychology, medicine, and physiology, shaping the study of stress response and related disorders.
