## What is the definition of allocentrism according to Psychologists?

allocentrism is A collectivistic characteristic of personality that involves people centring their attention and actions on other people rather than themselves. See also collectivism.

Collectivistic means a trait of a person's personality where they focus more on other people and their needs, rather than on themselves. It's like when someone cares about the well-being of their family, friends, or community a lot and puts their needs before their own. So, instead of only thinking about what they want or need, they think about what others want and try to help them. It's kind of like being selfless and preferring to work together as a group, rather than being only concerned about themselves.
