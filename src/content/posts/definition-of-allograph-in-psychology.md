## What is the definition of allograph according to Psychologists?

allograph is A letter that has been specified for its shape (e.g. by its case, or as print rather than script).

A shaped letter is a letter that looks different from the normal letters you see. It could be in a different form, like uppercase or lowercase. For example, the letter "A" can be written as "a", which looks different. Another example is when letters are printed, which means they are typed out, instead of written in cursive. These shaped letters are chosen on purpose to make words and sentences easier to read and understand.
