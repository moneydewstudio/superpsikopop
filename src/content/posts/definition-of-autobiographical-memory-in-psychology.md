## What is the definition of autobiographical memory according to Psychologists?

autobiographical memory is Personal memory of the development or experiences of our own selves throughout our lifetimes. See also memory, direct retrieval, generative retrieval, hyperthymestic syndrome.

Personal memory is when we remember things that happened to us or things we have experienced in our own lives. It's like a movie playing in our heads, but it's about our own lives instead of a made-up story. It's different from reading a book or hearing a story because we were actually there when it happened. Some people have really good memories and can remember a lot of things from a long time ago. They can even remember small details about what they did or what they saw. This is called hyperthymestic syndrome. Overall, personal memory is all about remembering our own life stories and the things we have gone through.
