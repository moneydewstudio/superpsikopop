## What is the definition of apprehension according to Psychologists?

apprehension is (i) In colloquial terms, a feeling of unease or dread concerning some future event. (ii) In cognitive terms, the mental grasping or full comprehension of a concept or idea.

(i) Imagine feeling really worried and scared about something that might happen in the future. Like when you have a weird feeling in your tummy and you can't stop thinking about it, even though it hasn't happened yet. That's what we mean by a feeling of unease or dread concerning some future event.

(ii) Okay, so let's say you learned something new, like how to solve a really hard math problem. When you understand it completely and you can explain it to someone else without any confusion, that's what we mean by grasping or fully comprehending a concept or idea. It's like your brain finally gets a solid hold on it and you know it really well.
