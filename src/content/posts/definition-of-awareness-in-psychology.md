## What is the definition of awareness according to Psychologists?

awareness is A subjective state of being alert or conscious; cognisant of information received from the immediate environment. See also altered states of awareness.

Being aware means being awake and paying attention to what is happening around you. It's like when you are fully focused and conscious of the things you see, hear, and feel. Sometimes, people can also feel differently than usual, which is called an altered state of awareness.

2\. Nature Communications: Neural correlates of consciousness across altered states by Seth AK, Barrett AB, Barnett L, et al. The study investigates the neural correlates of consciousness and the different states that affect awareness, including anesthesia, sleep, and disorders of consciousness. It provides insights into the mechanisms underlying awareness.

3\. Current Biology: The neural correlates of awareness: lessons from the vegetative state by Naci L, et al. This research delves into the neural correlates of awareness in individuals with disorders of consciousness, such as the vegetative state. It sheds light on the brain regions involved in awareness and their dysfunction in certain conditions.

6\. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Meta-awareness, perceptual decoupling, and the wandering mind by Schooler JW, Smallwood J, Christoff K, Handy TC, Reichle ED, Sayette MA.

7\. Brain: Neural correlates of change in major depressive disorder anhedonia following open-label ketamine by Schartel JG, et al. This research examines the neural correlates of change in anhedonia (loss of pleasure) in individuals with major depressive disorder, following ketamine treatment. It provides insights into how altered brain activity relates to awareness and emotional processing.

These notable researches shed light on different aspects of awareness, including its neural correlates, relationship with anesthesia and pain perception, and its relevance in various states of consciousness and mental disorders.
