## What is the definition of autochthonous according to Psychologists?

autochthonous is A term used to describe a state arising primarily from events within the individual, such as thirst or hunger.

The term is used to describe a feeling that happens inside someone when they need something. For example, when someone feels really thirsty or hungry, their body sends signals to their brain telling them that they need to drink water or eat food. So this term is just about those feelings that come from within a person when they need something.
