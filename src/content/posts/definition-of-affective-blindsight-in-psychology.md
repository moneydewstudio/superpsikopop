## What is the definition of affective blindsight according to Psychologists?

affective blindsight is The ability shown by some brain-damaged people who lack conscious visual perception but can nonetheless detect and distinguish between different emotional stimuli. See also blindsight.

Some people who have damage to their brain and can't see things consciously are still able to sense and tell apart different emotions. This is called blindsight.

 

## What are the example case of affective blindsight?

Affective blindsight refers to the phenomenon where individuals who are functionally blind due to damage in their primary visual cortex are still able to identify and respond to emotional stimuli unconsciously. Although not widely studied, there have been a few notable research studies on affective blindsight. Here are three important contributions to the field:

1\. Morris, DeGelder, Weiskrantz, and Dolan (2001): This study conducted by Morris and colleagues was one of the first to demonstrate affective blindsight in neurologically intact individuals. They presented facial expressions to patients with unilateral cortical damage causing blindness in one visual field. Although the participants were unable to consciously see the stimuli, they were able to accurately categorize and discriminate the emotional expression of the faces.

2\. Tamietto and de Gelder (2010): This study investigated affective blindsight in a patient known as "TN" who had extensive damage to his primary visual cortex due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Using various behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, the researchers demonstrated that TN could process and react to emotional face expressions despite his complete unawareness of the presence of the stimuli, supporting the concept of affective blindsight.

3\. Pegna, Landis, and Khateb (2008): This research explored affective blindsight in individuals with hemianopia, a condition resulting in blindness in half of the visual field. The study found that when emotional faces were presented within the blind area, participants showed physiological responses (changes in skin conductance response) that mirrored those of visibly presented emotional stimuli. This highlights the unconscious processing of affective information despite the lack of conscious awareness.

These studies have provided important evidence for the existence of affective blindsight, enhancing our understanding of the dissociation between conscious visual awareness and the recognition of emotional expressions. However, it is worth noting that research in this area is still relatively limited, and further investigations are needed to fully grasp the underlying mechanisms and implications of affective blindsight.

 

## What are other terms related to affective blindsight?

Unconscious Emotional Processing: Affective blindsight highlights the ability of the brain to process emotional stimuli without conscious awareness.

Physiological Responses: Although individuals may not report perceiving emotional stimuli, physiological responses such as changes in heart rate, skin conductance, or facial expressions may indicate an emotional reaction.

Brain Regions Involved: Affective blindsight is associated with the involvement of subcortical structures, such as the amygdala, which play a crucial role in emotional processing.

Emotion and Vision Interaction: Affective blindsight suggests that emotional and visual processing can be dissociated in the brain, emphasizing the complexity of the relationship between vision and emotion.
