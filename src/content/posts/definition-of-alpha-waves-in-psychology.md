## What is the definition of alpha waves according to Psychologists?

alpha waves is Distinctive low-amplitude low-frequency patterns of brain activity shown on EEG readings, consisting of a wave pattern of between 8 and 12 Hz, characteristic of a state of wakeful relaxation. Also referred to as alpha rhythms. See also beta waves, delta waves.

Distinctive brain patterns called alpha waves are seen when someone is relaxed and awake. These patterns can be seen using a test called EEG, which measures brain activity. Alpha waves have low intensity and occur at a frequency of 8 to 12 times per second. They are different from other brain waves called beta waves and delta waves.
