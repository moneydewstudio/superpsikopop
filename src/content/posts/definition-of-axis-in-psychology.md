> A line along which objects can be arranged according to some measure, as when people are given a position along a line that indicates increasing height. A graph usually consists of more than one axis (the plural is axes; see x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis). Objects can also be placed at given distances from an axis, and rotate around it, as the earth rotates around the NorthSouth axis.

## What is the definition of axis according to Psychologists?

axis is A line along which objects can be arranged according to some measure, as when people are given a position along a line that indicates increasing height. A graph usually consists of more than one axis (the plural is axes; see x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis). Objects can also be placed at given distances from an axis, and rotate around it, as the earth rotates around the NorthSouth axis.

A line is a straight path that goes from one point to another. It can be used to show how things compare or change. For example, if we want to compare people's heights, we can use a line to show who is taller and who is shorter. A graph is like a picture made with lines and numbers, and it can have more than one line. It helps us see patterns or relationships between things. In a graph, there are usually different lines going up and down or side to side. Each line is called an axis, and it can be named after a letter like x, y, or z.

We can also use a line to show how far away something is from a certain point. For example, we can show how far things are from the center of a circle. And sometimes, things can go around a line and rotate. Just like how the Earth rotates around an axis called the North-South axis.
