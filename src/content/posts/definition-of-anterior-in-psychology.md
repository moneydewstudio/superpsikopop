## What is the definition of anterior according to Psychologists?

anterior is Towards the front, or the most forward area. See also superior, posterior, inferior.

Towards the front means going or pointing in the direction of the front part of something. Think about when you are facing something, like when you are looking at a picture or a book. The front part is the side that is closest to you. So, if something is towards the front, it means it is closer to the front part compared to other things.

In our bodies, we use words to describe different areas. When we say "front" or "forward area," we mean the part that is in front or closest to where our faces are. We also use other words like "superior," which means higher up, or "posterior," which means towards the back, and "inferior," which means lower down.

So, if something is towards the front in a person's body, it means it is closer to the front part of their body compared to other things. It's kind of like standing at the front of a line  you are closer to the front compared to all the people behind you.
