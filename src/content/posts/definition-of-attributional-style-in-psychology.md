> The theory that individuals tend to believe in particular kinds of causes for a wide range of effects. Styles may vary in the extent to which they incline towards stable causes (ones that are unlikely to change in the future), global causes (affecting many things), and internalexternal causes (such as character or situation). For example, of two people who have failed an examination, one may attribute the cause to the room being noisy (unstable, specific and external), while the other may believe it is due to their being stupid (stable, global and internal). Martin Seligman and others have produced evidence that individuals who incline towards using a stable, global and internal pattern of attributions may be particularly vulnerable to depression.

## What is the definition of attributional style according to Psychologists?

attributional style is The theory that individuals tend to believe in particular kinds of causes for a wide range of effects. Styles may vary in the extent to which they incline towards stable causes (ones that are unlikely to change in the future), global causes (affecting many things), and internalexternal causes (such as character or situation). For example, of two people who have failed an examination, one may attribute the cause to the room being noisy (unstable, specific and external), while the other may believe it is due to their being stupid (stable, global and internal). Martin Seligman and others have produced evidence that individuals who incline towards using a stable, global and internal pattern of attributions may be particularly vulnerable to depression. See also personal attributions, controllable attributions, Leeds Attributional Coding System.

The theory says that people tend to believe certain things are the cause of different things that happen. There are different ways people think about these causes. Some people think the causes won't change in the future, some think the causes affect many things, and some think the causes are because of who they are or the situation they're in.

For example, let's say two people failed a test. One person might think the reason they failed is because the room was too noisy (which might not happen again and was something outside of their control), while the other person might think they failed because they're not smart (which they think is always true and affects everything in their life).

Some scientists have found that people who always think in this stable, global, and internal way might be more likely to become depressed. This means they might feel sad and unhappy for longer periods of time.
