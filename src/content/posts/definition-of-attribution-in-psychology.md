## What is the definition of attribution according to Psychologists?

attribution is The process of ascribing reasons or causes to events. Causal attributions are often concerned with suggesting the possible motives or intentionality underlying peoples actions, and a number of researchers have explored how variations in attributions can have wide-reaching effects. See also attribution theory, covariance, animism.

Causal attributions means trying to figure out why something happened or why someone did something. People guess at the possible reasons behind people's actions or events that occur. Some researchers have studied this and found that different guesses can have big effects on how we think about things. We can also see this as part of attribution theory, which is about how we explain and understand things that happen. It is also connected to the idea of covariance, which is about how things relate to each other, and animism, which is the belief that objects have feelings or intentions.
