## What is the definition of aptitude according to Psychologists?

aptitude is The ease with which a person will acquire a new set of skills or abilities. An individual is said to have an aptitude for a particular skill if he or she learns that skill more rapidly and with more ease than other individuals with the same prior knowledge.

Think of aptitude as being really good at learning something quickly and easily. Let's say there are two people, both trying to learn how to play the piano. One person has a higher aptitude for playing the piano, which means they will learn and pick up the skills needed to play much faster and easier compared to the other person who may take longer to learn. It's like having a natural talent that helps you become really good at something without much effort!
