## What is the definition of affect according to Psychologists?

affect is (i)         A term used to mean emotion but covering a much wider spectrum of feelings than normal emotions. Affect includes pleasurable sensations, friendliness and warmth, pensiveness, and mild dislike, as well as extreme emotions such as joy, exhilaration, fear andhatred. Broadly speaking, affect refers to any category of feeling, as distinct from cognition or behaviour.(ii)        As a verb: to influence, to have an effect. Note that the verb to affect means to cause. An effect is a result. See also effect.

(i) Affect is a word that describes our emotions, but it covers more than just regular emotions. It includes things like feeling happy or warm, feeling thoughtful, or even feeling slightly annoyed. It can also include really intense emotions like feeling super excited, scared, or full of hate. Basically, affect is a word that includes all different kinds of feelings, instead of just how we think or act.

(ii) When we use 'affect' as a verb, it means to influence or have an effect on something. It's like causing something to happen. It's important to note that 'an effect' is the result or outcome of something. So, the verb 'to affect' is about making something happen, while 'an effect' is what happens as a result.

 

## What are the example case of affect?

One of the most important and notable research papers regarding the term "affect" is "The Atlas of Emotion: Mapping Trade-offs between Positive and Negative Affect" by Jennifer S. Lerner and colleagues (2015).

This research paper aims to understand the underlying dimensions of affect and how they relate to emotional experiences. The authors introduce the concept of the "affect grid," which visually maps a person's emotional experience on a two-dimensional grid. One axis represents the level of positive affect, ranging from pleasant to unpleasant, while the other axis represents the level of arousal, ranging from low to high.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers provide evidence supporting their claim that affect can be understood as a combination of valence (positive or negative) and arousal. They argue that emotions are not discrete categories but rather exist on a continuum, which allows for a more nuanced understanding of affect.

The significance of this research lies in its attempt to create a standardized framework for understanding and measuring affect. By mapping emotions on a two-dimensional grid, the authors provide a comprehensive visual representation of how emotions are experienced, which can be useful in various fields including psychology, neuroscience, and decision-making research. This paper has contributed to our understanding of affect and has influenced subsequent research in the field.
