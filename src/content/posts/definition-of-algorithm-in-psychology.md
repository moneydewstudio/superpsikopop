## What is the definition of algorithm according to Psychologists?

algorithm is A routine procedure that will produce a correct answer with enough repetitions or applications. If an algorithm exists for a problem, you know it can eventually be solved simply by following the procedure. Algorithms have passed into common awareness through their use by social media engines to target information and advertising according to the individuals past choices. See also heuristics, problem-solving.

An algorithm is a step-by-step process that you can follow to solve a problem. It's like having a recipe for making cookies - if you follow the instructions correctly, you will always end up with delicious cookies. Algorithms are also used by social media platforms to show you things that you might be interested in based on what you've liked or looked at before. So, they use algorithms to figure out what you might want to see and show you those things.

 

## What are the example case of algorithm?

There have been numerous significant research developments related to the term "algorithm." Here are some notable ones:

1\. Euclidean Algorithm: Proposed by Euclid of Alexandria around 300 BC, this algorithm is one of the oldest and most fundamental algorithms in mathematics. It allows for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers efficiently, forming the basis for many modern cryptographic systems and computational number theory.

2\. PageRank Algorithm: Developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in the late 1990s, the PageRank algorithm revolutionized web search by providing an effective way to rank web pages based on their importance. It heavily influenced the founding of Google and became a significant milestone in information retrieval.

3\. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): Developed by James Cooley and John Tukey in the 1960s, the FFT algorithm is essential for efficiently computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The FFT has numerous applications in signal processing, image processing, data compression, and many other areas.

4\. A\* Search Algorithm: Proposed by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson, and Bertram Raphael in 1968, the A\* algorithm is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. It combines the concepts of heuristic functions and best-first search to find the optimal path between two points efficiently, making it a crucial algorithm in artificial intelligence and computer games.

5\. RSA Cryptosystem: Invented by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1977, the RSA algorithm is one of the most widely used asymmetric encryption algorithms. Its security relies on the factorization of large numbers, providing the foundation for secure communication and data privacy on the internet.

6\. Deep Learning and Neural Networks: While not a single algorithm, deep learning research has made transformative contributions to various fields. Deep neural networks, in particular, have achieved remarkable success in image recognition, natural language processing, and other areas, propelling advancements in areas such as computer vision and speech recognition.

These are just a few notable research developments related to algorithms, each of which has had a significant impact on their respective fields. There are many more influential algorithms and research papers available, depending on specific areas of interest.
