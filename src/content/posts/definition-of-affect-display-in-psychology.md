## What is the definition of affect display according to Psychologists?

affect display is Overt signs such as posture, breathing, pupil dilation and raising of fur, which indicate the emotional state of the person or animal. See also autonomic nervous system.

Overt signs are clear and noticeable behaviors or physical changes that show how someone or an animal is feeling. These signs can include how they sit or stand, how they breathe, the size of their pupils, and even if their fur or hair stands up. These signs give us clues about the person or animal's emotions, such as if they're happy, scared, excited, or nervous. The autonomic nervous system is also related to these signs and it's responsible for controlling automatic bodily functions such as breathing and heart rate.

 

## What are the example case of affect display?

One notable and important research related to the term "affect display" is the work by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen, who extensively studied facial expressions of emotions. Their study, published in 1969, titled "The Repertoire of Nonverbal Behavior: Categories, Origins, Usage, and Coding" laid the foundation for understanding and coding affect displays.

Ekman and Friesen introduced the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a comprehensive tool for objectively analyzing facial expressions. FACS assigns a distinct code to each muscle movement in the face, allowing researchers to accurately identify and classify facial expressions of emotions. This research significantly advanced our understanding of affect displays and offered a standardized methodology for their measurement.

Another notable research paper is "The Duchenne Smile: Emotional Expression and Brain Physiology. II" by Paul Ekman, Richard J. Davidson, and Wallace V. Friesen in 1990. This study highlighted the specific facial expressions associated with genuine smiles. They coined the term "Duchenne smile" after Guillaume Duchenne, who first documented the genuine smile involving activity in both the zygomatic major (cheek raiser) and orbicularis oculi (eye crinkler) muscles. This research revealed important nuances in affect displays related to different emotional states.

Overall, these studies and methodologies have significantly contributed to our understanding of affect displays and their role in nonverbal communication and emotional expression.
