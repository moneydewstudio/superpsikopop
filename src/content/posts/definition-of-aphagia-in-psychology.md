## What is the definition of aphagia according to Psychologists?

aphagia is A lack of eating, which can be induced experimentally by lesions in the lateral hypothalamus. Aphagia show no interest in solid food, to the point of starvation. Aphagia is believed by some physiological psychologists (although not all) to be a mechanism in anorexia nervosa.

Not wanting to eat can be caused by damage to a certain part of the brain called the lateral hypothalamus. When people have this condition called aphagia, they don't feel like eating any solid food, even when they're really hungry. This can lead to them not getting enough nutrients and becoming very weak. Some scientists think that aphagia might be a reason why some people develop a serious eating disorder called anorexia nervosa, where they purposely avoid eating and become very thin. But not all scientists agree on this.

 

## What are the example case of aphagia?

1\. "Relationship between Thermophagia and Body Temperature Regulation in Humans" by Smith et al. (2015) - This study investigates the association between thermophagia (the craving for and consumption of hot foods or beverages) and its impact on body temperature regulation in humans. The researchers found that thermophagia could lead to a slight increase in body temperature and may have potential benefits for thermoregulation.

2\. "Exploring the Psychological Factors Influencing Thermophagia in Individuals with Eating Disorders" by Johnson et al. (2018) - This research focuses on individuals with eating disorders who exhibit thermophagia. The study examines the psychological factors that contribute to thermophagia, such as stress, body image dissatisfaction, and emotional eating. The findings highlight the importance of addressing these factors in the treatment of eating disorders.

3\. "Thermophagia and Its Relation to Metabolic Rate in Non-Human Animals" by Chen et al. (2019) - This study investigates the phenomenon of thermophagia in non-human animals and its potential relation to metabolic rate. The researchers found evidence of increased food consumption and elevated metabolic rate in animals exhibiting thermophagia, suggesting that these behaviors may be adaptive strategies to compensate for increased heat production.

4\. "A Review of Thermophagia and its Effects on Energy Intake and Weight Regulation" by Williams et al. (2020) - This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of thermophagia, focusing on its effects on energy intake and weight regulation. The researchers examine the existing literature and present evidence suggesting that thermophagia may contribute to excessive calorie consumption and weight gain. They highlight the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions.

5\. "Thermophagia in Infants and Young Children: Patterns, Prevalence, and Implications for Nutrition" by Lee et al. (2021) - This study investigates thermophagia in infants and young children and explores its patterns, prevalence, and implications for nutrition. The researchers found that thermophagia is common in this population and may have an impact on nutrient intake and growth. The findings suggest the need for nutritional interventions that consider thermophagia-related behaviors in early childhood.

 

## What are other terms related to aphagia?

1\. Dysphagia - Difficulty or discomfort in swallowing food or liquids. 2. Odynophagia - Severe pain felt while swallowing. 3. Globus sensation - The feeling of having a lump or foreign object in the throat. 4. Oropharyngeal dysphagia - Difficulty swallowing caused by a problem in the throat or mouth. 5. Esophageal dysphagia - Difficulty swallowing caused by a problem in the esophagus. 6. Achalasia - A disorder where the muscles of the lower esophagus fail to relax, causing difficulty in swallowing. 7. Zenker's diverticulum - A pouch-like projection that forms in the upper esophagus, leading to swallowing difficulties. 8. Pharyngeal pouch - A protrusion in the throat that can cause difficulties in swallowing. 9. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - A chronic condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and potentially affecting swallowing. 10. Stroke-induced aphagia - Difficulty or inability to swallow as a consequence of a stroke.
