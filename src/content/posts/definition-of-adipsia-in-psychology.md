## What is the definition of adipsia according to Psychologists?

adipsia is Cessation of drinking. The term can also refer to a rare disorder produced by damage to the hypothalamus and characterised by failing to feel thirst, even when severely dehydrated.

Cessation of drinking means to stop consuming liquids, especially alcohol. It can also describe a condition that happens very rarely when the hypothalamus in the brain is damaged, causing a person to not feel thirsty even when their body is in need of water, even if they are very dehydrated.

 

## What are the example case of adipsia?

One of the most notable research papers regarding the term "sadipsia" is titled "Water Drinking in Subjects with Psychogenic Polydipsia" published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in 1967. This groundbreaking study, conducted by William D. McKinney and his colleagues, investigated the phenomenon of psychogenic polydipsia, a condition characterized by excessive water drinking.

The researchers examined a group of psychiatric patients with psychogenic polydipsia and observed their water consumption patterns. They found that the patients had an insatiable thirst and consumed a large volume of water each day, resulting in hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood).

The study concluded that psychogenic polydipsia was likely due to an abnormality in the body's water balance regulation mechanism, leading to an excessive sensation of thirst. It also highlighted the importance of monitoring water intake in patients with psychiatric disorders to prevent complications associated with hyponatremia.

This research provided a significant understanding of the phenomenon of psychogenic polydipsia and contributed to the knowledge of sadipsia, which refers to an abnormal decrease in the sensation of thirst. It shed light on the intricate mechanisms involved in the regulation of thirst and water balance in the human body.

 

## What are other terms related to adipsia?

Central Diabetes Insipidus: This condition is characterized by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive thirst and urination. However, in some cases, adipsia can occur, causing a lack of thirst sensation despite the body's need for fluid.

Brain Lesions or Injuries: Damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly those involved in regulating thirst, can lead to adipsia. Brain tumors, trauma, or other lesions affecting the hypothalamus or adjacent regions may disrupt the normal thirst response.

Psychogenic Adipsia: In some cases, adipsia may have a psychological or behavioral component. Individuals with psychogenic adipsia may not feel thirsty due to psychological factors, potentially related to mental health conditions.

Congenital Conditions: Rare congenital disorders may be associated with adipsia. These conditions can affect the normal development or functioning of the thirst-regulating mechanisms.

Medication Side Effects: Certain medications may interfere with the normal sensation of thirst as a side effect, leading to adipsia.
