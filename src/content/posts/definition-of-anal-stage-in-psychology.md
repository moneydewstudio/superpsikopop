## What is the definition of anal stage according to Psychologists?

anal stage is The second of Freuds psychosexual stages, in which libido focuses on the anus. See also oral, phallic stage.

The second stage of Freud's theory is called the anal stage. In this stage, children become interested in their poop and going to the bathroom. They start to learn how to control when and where they poop. This stage happens after the first stage, where babies focus on their mouth and sucking on things.

 

## What are the example case of anal stage?

One of the most important and notable research studies regarding the anal stage is Sigmund Freud's work on psychosexual development. Freud proposed a stage theory of psychosexual development, where the anal stage is the second stage that occurs from around 18 months to 3 years of age. It is during this stage that the child's focus of pleasure and developmental conflicts center around the anal region.

Freud's work emphasized the significance of toilet training during the anal stage and its impact on the child's personality development. He suggested that successful completion of toilet training leads to the child developing a sense of autonomy and control, while fixation or trauma during this stage can result in anal-retentive or anal-expulsive personality traits.

Furthermore, Anna Freud, Sigmund Freud's daughter, expanded on his theories and contributed significantly to our understanding of the anal stage. She did extensive research on child psychoanalysis, including the anal personality and its relation to the functions of the anus and associated psychopathologies.

It is important to note that Freud's psychosexual stage theory and his emphasis on the anal stage have been met with criticism and are not widely supported in contemporary psychology. However, these studies are notable as they laid the foundation for further research and discussion on the role of early childhood experiences in personality development.
