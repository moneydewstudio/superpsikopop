## What is the definition of affiliative needs according to Psychologists?

affiliative needs is Needs that relate to a sense of belonging with, or friendship towards, other people. This rests on the idea that the wish for affiliation is a kind of drive, so that the strength of the need for affiliation (nAff) can be studied in the same kind of way that other physiological needs are studied. See also motivation.

This is about the needs we have to feel like we belong or have friends. It's like a desire we have, similar to other needs our body has, like being hungry or thirsty. This desire is called the need for affiliation, and it can be studied just like we study other physical needs. It's all about understanding what motivates us to seek connections and friendships with others.

 

## What are the example case of affiliative needs?

One notable research study on affiliative needs is "The Need to Belong: Desire for Interpersonal Attachments as a Fundamental Human Motivation" by Roy F. Baumeister and Mark R. Leary. This paper, published in 1995, explores the concept of affiliative needs and their implications for human behavior and well-being.

Baumeister and Leary argue that humans have an inherent psychological need to form and maintain strong social connections with others. They propose that the need to belong is a fundamental motivation that influences various aspects of human behavior, including emotional regulation, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships.

The researchers conducted a series of studies to support their argument, including demonstrating that social exclusion and loneliness have negative effects on psychological well-being and cognitive functioning. They also found that fulfilling the need to belong is associated with positive outcomes such as increased happiness, mental and physical health, and a sense of purpose in life.

This research highlights the importance of affiliative needs in human life, suggesting that satisfying these needs is crucial for individuals' overall well-being. It has significant implications for understanding social behavior, mental health, and fostering positive interpersonal relationships.
