> A central concept in the theory of obedience developed by Milgram, in which he proposed that human beings, as social animals, have two alternative and mutually exclusive states of social being. One of these is known as the autonomous state, in which people act as independent, selfgoverning individuals, and in which their personal conscience and morality inform and direct their choices of action. The other, known as the agentic state, occurs when people act simply as an agent for others higher up in the social order.

## What is the definition of autonomous state according to Psychologists?

autonomous state is A central concept in the theory of obedience developed by Milgram, in which he proposed that human beings, as social animals, have two alternative and mutually exclusive states of social being. One of these is known as the autonomous state, in which people act as independent, selfgoverning individuals, and in which their personal conscience and morality inform and direct their choices of action. The other, known as the agentic state, occurs when people act simply as an agent for others higher up in the social order.

In Milgram's theory about obedience, he says that people can be in two different states when it comes to following others. One state is called the autonomous state, where people make decisions on their own based on their own conscience and morals. The other state is called the agentic state, where people act like a middleman for someone else who has more power or authority.
