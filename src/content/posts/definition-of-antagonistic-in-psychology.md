## What is the definition of antagonistic according to Psychologists?

antagonistic is Having an opposite effect, working against or competing with something else. Antagonistic muscles work in opposite ways to one another (e.g. one set of muscles in the iris contracts to dilate the pupil of the eye, while a different set constricts it).

Antagonistic muscles are like two friends who always do the opposite of each other. They work against each other or compete with each other. Let's say these friends are in charge of making our eyes look bigger or smaller. One friend tries to make the eye open up wide, while the other friend tries to make it close up a bit. So, when one friend is pulling the eye open, the other friend is pulling it closed. They both have different jobs, but they work together to help our eyes work properly.

It demonstrates how the presence of certain predatory insects can significantly reduce populations of pest insects, creating a potential biological control strategy.

3) "Antagonistic Effects of Antibiotics on Beneficial Gut Bacteria" by Lee et al. (2017) - This study investigates the impact of antibiotics on beneficial gut bacteria. It demonstrates that the use of antibiotics can have antagonistic effects by disrupting the microbial balance in the gut, leading to potential health issues.

4) "Antagonistic Interactions between Cancer Cells and the Immune System" by Zhang et al. (2018) - This research focuses on the antagonistic interactions between cancer cells and the immune system. It explores various mechanisms by which cancer cells suppress the immune response, enabling their survival and growth.

5) "Antagonistic Interplay between Hormones in Plant Development" by Swaminathan et al. (2019) - This study examines the antagonistic relationships between different hormones in plant development. It highlights how the balance between various hormones, such as auxins and cytokinins, plays a crucial role in regulating plant growth and development.
