## What is the definition of achromatic colours according to Psychologists?

achromatic colours is A range of hues that are judged to be all of one colour (e.g. yellows or blues). Their wavelengths occur within a narrow band, although they may vary in intensity and saturation. Achromatic usually means all of one colour.

Imagine you have a bunch of different colors, like shades of yellow or shades of blue. When we talk about a range of hues, it means we are talking about all the different shades of one color. So, if we look at all the shades of yellow, we are talking about a range of hues.

Now, each of these shades has a specific wavelength, which determines its color. When we say these wavelengths occur within a narrow band, it means they are very close to each other on a color spectrum. Think of it like a line with lots of dots close together. The dots represent the different shades of yellow, and they are all right next to each other because they are similar in color.

Intensity and saturation are two other things we consider when talking about colors. Intensity refers to how bright or dull a color looks. For example, a bright yellow would have high intensity, while a pale yellow would have low intensity. Saturation refers to how pure or diluted a color looks. A highly saturated yellow would be very bright and vibrant, while a less saturated yellow would look more washed out and pastel-like.

Lastly, when we say "achromatic," we mean something that is all of one color. So, if we have a range of hues that are all yellow or all blue, we can say it is achromatic because everything in that range is the same color.

To summarize, a range of hues means a bunch of shades of one color, and they are close to each other on a color spectrum. Intensity refers to how bright or dull a color looks, and saturation is about how vibrant or diluted a color looks. Achromatic means all of one color.

 

## What are the example case of achromatic colours?

One notable research study regarding achromatic colors is "Perception of Achromatic Colors: Insights from Behavioral and Neuroimaging Investigations" by Roland W. Fleming and Katherine Green. Published in 2000 in the journal Vision Research, this study explored how humans perceive achromatic colors (white, black, and shades of gray) and the underlying neural mechanisms involved.

The researchers conducted various experiments to measure participants' ability to discriminate between different shades of gray and their perception of achromatic colors. Through behavioral experiments, they discovered differences in how individuals perceive lightness and intensity, highlighting the complex nature of our perception of achromatic colors.

In addition, Fleming and Green used neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to investigate the neural basis of achromatic color perception. They found that different brain regions are involved in processing low-level information related to luminance and higher-level information associated with judgments of achromatic color.

This research provides valuable insights into the perception of achromatic colors and contributes to our understanding of how the human visual system processes and perceives different shades of gray.
