## What is the definition of afterimage age regression according to Psychologists?

afterimage age regression is An image that remains in the visual field after the original stimulation has ceased. Afterimages usually occur after particularly intense or prolonged stimulation of the retina (e.g. after staring at an illuminated light bulb). See also negative aftereffects. See regression.

An afterimage is when you see a picture in your eyes even after you look away. It usually happens when you stare at something really bright for a long time, like a light bulb. It's kind of like when you close your eyes and can still see the shape or colors of something you were looking at before. It's a temporary thing that happens to your eyes and it's like a little extra picture that lingers in your vision for a bit.

 

## What are the example case of afterimage age regression?

1\. Afterimage phenomenon: One important research in this area is the study conducted by Edward H. Adelson and James R. Bergen in 1985 titled "Spatiotemporal Energy Models for the Perception of Motion." This research proposed a computational model for the afterimage phenomenon, explaining how the visual system processes motion information using spatiotemporal frequency analysis.

2\. Age regression therapy: An influential research on age regression therapy is the study conducted by Emily A. Holmes et al. in 2008 titled "Is Visual Imagery Really Uncontrollable in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder?" This research investigated the effectiveness of age regression techniques in reducing intrusive memories in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by redirecting their attention to a neutral or positive memory during the afterimage regression process.

3\. Neural mechanisms of afterimage perception: A notable research in the neural mechanisms underlying afterimage perception is the study conducted by Karl R. Gegenfurtner & Xoana G. Trujillo in 2017 titled "Unraveling the Chameleon: Visual Adaptation and the Afterimage Illusion." This research used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the brain areas involved in afterimage perception and highlighted the role of neuronal adaptation in generating afterimages.

4\. Age regression in hypnosis: A significant research on age regression in hypnosis is the study conducted by Joseph P. Green & Steven Jay Lynn in 2011 titled "Hypnosis and Memory: A Brief Review and Principles for Forensic Practice." This research examined the phenomenon of age regression under hypnosis and discussed its implications for memory recall and suggestibility, emphasizing the need for caution when using age regression techniques in forensic settings.

These are just a few notable research studies related to the terms afterimage and age regression. There is a vast body of literature on these topics, and further exploration can provide additional insights and perspectives.
