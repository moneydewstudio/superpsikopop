## What is the definition of autonomous stage of skill acquisition according to Psychologists?

When you practice something a lot, it becomes a habit and you can do it without thinking too hard. It's like riding a bike or tying your shoes  you can do it without having to concentrate too much. This is called automaticity, where you can perform a skill without having to pay full attention to it. It's sort of like your brain has memorized the steps and can do them automatically without you even realizing it.
