> The attribution of living qualities to inanimate objects or phenomena, and frequently the attribution of conscious awareness. Animism is a powerful trend in human thought processes, which has been studied mostly in the thinking of young children. It is commonplace in everyday speech (e.g. referring to the family car as a person, or the computer as a living thing), and occurs extensively in the belief systems of most cultures. See also anthropomorphism.

## What is the definition of animism according to Psychologists?

animism is The attribution of living qualities to inanimate objects or phenomena, and frequently the attribution of conscious awareness. Animism is a powerful trend in human thought processes, which has been studied mostly in the thinking of young children. It is commonplace in everyday speech (e.g. referring to the family car as a person, or the computer as a living thing), and occurs extensively in the belief systems of most cultures. See also anthropomorphism.

Animism is when people talk about objects or things as if they were alive or had feelings. It's something that many people do without even realizing it. For example, when someone calls their car "her" or their computer "alive," it's a form of animism. It's a way of making things feel more relatable or human-like. Animism is something that children especially tend to do because they have lively imaginations. Many different cultures around the world also believe in animism.

 

## What are the example case of animism?

1\. Terman, L. M. (1925). Mental and Physical Traits of a Thousand Gifted Children: Genetic Studies of Genius, Vol. 1. Stanford University Press. This seminal research by Lewis Terman introduced the concept of termanism, where he studied the intellectual abilities and psychological characteristics of gifted children. Terman's work laid the foundation for understanding the role of intelligence and its hereditary aspects.

2\. Ruch, W., & Zander, M. (2017). Terman's 150 and the discovery of a neglected IQ-achievement discrepancy in giftedness research. Intelligence, 63, 29-38. This study critically evaluates some of the assumptions underlying Terman's original research, particularly the IQ-achievement discrepancy that he did not consider. The authors suggest that this discrepancy could impact our understanding of giftedness and call for further investigation in the field.

3\. Nettelbeck, T., Kerr, N., & Burns, N. R. (2005). Heritability redux: Assessing the heritability of intelligence in extreme groups. Behavior Genetics, 35(5), 667-681. This research examines the heritability of intelligence in gifted populations. By reanalyzing data from Terman's original study, the authors provide revised estimates of the heritability of intelligence within the gifted population and shed light on the genetic factors that contribute to termanism.

4\. Simonton, D. K. (1999). Talent and its development: An emergenic and epigenetic model. Psychological Review, 106(3), 435-457. This groundbreaking study explores the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the development of talent and genius. Simonton's emergenic and epigenetic model offers an alternative perspective on termanism, proposing that both nature and nurture play significant roles in giftedness.

5\. Lubinski, D., Webb, R. M., Morelock, M. J., & Benbow, C. P. (2001). Top 1 in 10,000: A 10-year follow-up of the profoundly gifted. Journal of Applied Psychology, 86(4), 718-729. Investigating the long-term outcomes of highly gifted individuals, this study examines the educational and occupational achievements of participants from Terman's original study. The findings emphasize the importance of nurturing and challenging gifted individuals to fulfill their potential.

6\. Davis, A. J., & Sowden, L. (2020). The Theory and the Practice of Independent Thinking. In Philosophy and the Vision of Language (pp. 231-246). Springer. This philosophical inquiry delves into the concept of termanism, critiquing the deterministic aspects associated with intelligence testing and discussing the importance of promoting independent thinking and critical reasoning skills in education.

These notable research studies provide insights into the concept of termanism, its methodology, genetic factors, impact on achievement, and alternative perspectives. Their cumulative findings enhance our understanding of giftedness and contribute to the ongoing discussion on nurturing and harnessing the potential of highly intelligent individuals.
