## What is the definition of afferent neurone according to Psychologists?

afferent neurone is A nerve cell (neurone) that carries information in the form of electrical impulses from the sense organs to the central nervous system. Also known as a sensory neurone. See also efferent neurone.

A nerve cell, also known as a neuron, is like a messenger in our body. It carries information as electrical signals from our senses, such as sight, touch, or taste, to our central nervous system, which includes our brain and spinal cord. This type of neuron is called a sensory neuron because it helps us sense and feel things. It's like a bridge that connects what we sense with our brain, so we can understand what is happening around us.

One notable research paper regarding the term "afferent neuron" is:

Title: "Afferent Neurons Control Calcium Signaling in Glia-Neuron Networks of the CNS" Authors: Eugene V. Khain and Valery I. Shestopalov Published: 2019 in Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience

Summary: This research investigates the role of afferent neurons in regulating calcium signaling between glial cells and neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). The authors demonstrate that afferent neurons play a critical role in this communication by releasing ATP, which triggers calcium waves in astrocytes, affecting synaptic transmission and neuronal activity. The study provides important insights into the functional interactions of afferent neurons and glial cells, highlighting their role in CNS signaling.

This research is significant as it elucidates the precise mechanisms by which afferent neurons influence glia-neuron networks, shedding light on the complex interactions that underlie the transmission of sensory information and overall CNS function.
