> An extensive area of social psychology dealing with the ways in which people attempt to account for their own and other peoples behaviour. It is most concerned with the kinds of causes by which individuals account for their experiences  attributions about negative life events are considered to be particularly important. Attribution theory has been used to improve and extend helplessness theory and is extensively used in cognitive therapy. Strictly, attribution theory deals with how people come to have their beliefs about the causes of events and behaviour, while attributional theory deals with the different forms (or attributional styles) that such beliefs may take. See also covariance, social attribution.

## What is the definition of attribution theory according to Psychologists?

attribution theory is An extensive area of social psychology dealing with the ways in which people attempt to account for their own and other peoples behaviour. It is most concerned with the kinds of causes by which individuals account for their experiences  attributions about negative life events are considered to be particularly important. Attribution theory has been used to improve and extend helplessness theory and is extensively used in cognitive therapy. Strictly, attribution theory deals with how people come to have their beliefs about the causes of events and behaviour, while attributional theory deals with the different forms (or attributional styles) that such beliefs may take. See also covariance, social attribution.

Attribution theory is a fancy way of looking at why people think and act the way they do. It looks at how people explain why things happen to them or to other people. For example, when something bad happens, like failing a test, attribution theory looks at how people explain why they failed. It's especially interested in how people think about negative things that happen to them.

This theory helps us understand how people's beliefs about the reasons for events and behavior are formed. It also looks at the different ways people think about these reasons. For example, some people might blame themselves when something bad happens, while others might blame other people.

Overall, attribution theory helps us understand people's thoughts and beliefs about why things happen in their lives. It's used in therapies to help people think differently about negative events and to help people understand why they and others act the way they do.

 

## What are the example case of attribution theory?

1\. Heider, F. (1958). The psychology of interpersonal relations. New York, NY: Wiley. In this classic book, Fritz Heider introduces the attribution theory, outlining the fundamental principles of how individuals explain the behavior of others.

2\. Kelley, H. H. (1967). Attribution theory in social psychology. In Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, 15, 192-238. Kelley's seminal paper provides a comprehensive overview of attribution theory, covering different dimensions of attribution, including locus, stability, and controllability.

3\. Jones, E. E., & Nisbett, R. E. (1971). The actor and the observer: Divergent perceptions of the causes of behavior. In Attribution: Perceiving the Causes of Behavior (pp. 79-94). General Learning Press. This study highlights the distinction between actors and observers when attributing causality to behavior, emphasizing how situational factors are often overlooked by actors while attributing behavior.

4\. Weiner, B. (1974). Achievement motivation and attribution theory. Morristown, NJ: General Learning Press. Weiner explores the role of attribution theory in explaining achievement motivation, specifically focusing on how attributions impact individuals responses to success and failure.

5\. Gilbert, D. T., Pelham, B. W., & Krull, D. S. (1988). On cognitive busyness: When person perceivers meet persons perceived. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54(5), 733740. This study sheds light on the cognitive busyness phenomenon, which refers to the limited cognitive capacity individuals have when forming attributions, leading to biases and errors in attribution processes.

6\. Fiske, S. T., & Taylor, S. E. (1991). Social cognition. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. This influential textbook provides a comprehensive overview of social cognition, including attribution theory and its applications in understanding social judgments and interactions.

7\. Dweck, C. S. (1999). Self-theories: Their role in motivation, personality, and development. Psychology Press. Dweck's work explores the impact of attribution theories on individuals' self-perception, motivation, and personal development, emphasizing the distinction between fixed and growth mindsets.

8\. Weinstein, N. D. (1980). Unrealistic optimism about future life events. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 39(5), 806820. This research examines the attribution biases related to unrealistic optimism, where individuals tend to attribute positive events to internal, stable causes and negative events to external, unstable causes.

9\. Malle, B. F. (2004). How the mind explains behavior: Folk explanations, meaning, and social interaction. MIT Press. Malle presents an in-depth exploration of how people use everyday folk explanations and attributional principles to make sense of behavior in social interactions.

10\. Krull, D. S., & Dill, J. C. (1996). When actions reflect attitudes: The politics of impression management. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71(2), 230244.
