> A person who has become dependent on the drug alcohol. Many problems dealt with by clinical psychologists are caused or aggravated by alcohol (e.g. some 30 per cent of cases of physical child abuse). Alcoholism is treated in a number of different ways by different practitioners, including clinical psychologists, with varying degrees of success. There is controversy over the question of whether total abstinence is essential for anyone who has been an alcoholic. Alcoholism is probably the most widespread and damaging addiction. See also antabuse, Korsakoffs syndrome.

## What is the definition of alcoholic according to Psychologists?

alcoholic is A person who has become dependent on the drug alcohol. Many problems dealt with by clinical psychologists are caused or aggravated by alcohol (e.g. some 30 per cent of cases of physical child abuse). Alcoholism is treated in a number of different ways by different practitioners, including clinical psychologists, with varying degrees of success. There is controversy over the question of whether total abstinence is essential for anyone who has been an alcoholic. Alcoholism is probably the most widespread and damaging addiction. See also antabuse, Korsakoffs syndrome.

A person who is dependent on alcohol is someone who can't control their drinking and needs alcohol to function. This can lead to many problems, like physical child abuse, which happens in about 30% of cases linked to alcohol. Clinical psychologists are experts who try to help people with these problems, but there are different ways they can do it, and it may not always work for everyone. Some people think that completely stopping drinking is necessary for anyone who has had an alcohol problem, but there is a lot of debate about this. Alcoholism is a very common and harmful addiction. You might also hear about treatments like antabuse and Korsakoff's syndrome, which are related to alcoholism.

 

## What are the example case of alcoholic?

One important and notable research area regarding alcoholism is the understanding of its genetic basis and heritability. Numerous studies have shown that alcoholism has a significant genetic component, with estimates ranging from 40-60% heritability. The identification of specific genes or genetic variations associated with alcoholism has provided insights into the biological mechanisms underlying this disorder.

For instance, the research on the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the enzyme it produces has shown variations in this gene that affect the rate at which alcohol is metabolized, influencing alcohol sensitivity and the risk of developing alcoholism. Similarly, genes involved in the reward system of the brain, such as those encoding the dopamine receptors, have been linked to alcohol addiction.

Another area of notable research is the investigation of neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcohol addiction. Advanced imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have provided insights into the brain regions and circuits involved in alcohol addiction. Research has shown that chronic alcohol consumption leads to neuroadaptations in these brain regions, contributing to the development of tolerance, dependence, and craving.

Furthermore, research has also investigated the role of social and environmental factors in alcoholism. Studies have examined the influence of family, peer, and societal factors on the risk of developing alcohol use disorders. They have provided evidence for the significant impact of social and environmental contexts, including family history of alcoholism, childhood trauma, availability of alcohol, and cultural norms, on the initiation, progression, and maintenance of alcohol addiction.

It is important to note that alcoholism is a complex and multifactorial disorder, and research in this field is extensive. The areas mentioned above represent some of the notable and influential areas of research in understanding the term "alcoholic" and its underlying causes and mechanisms.
