> A term used to describe conformity arising despite awareness that, if the individual stated their own judgement openly, they would be responding differently to the rest of the group, and others would become aware of their dissent. Aschs studies of conformity involved a research participant placed in a situation in which the other group members had been primed to give obviously wrong answers to a relatively simple problem, and the real participant had to answer openly, after the majority had answered. See bandwagon effect.

## What is the definition of Asch effect according to Psychologists?

Asch effect is A term used to describe conformity arising despite awareness that, if the individual stated their own judgement openly, they would be responding differently to the rest of the group, and others would become aware of their dissent. Aschs studies of conformity involved a research participant placed in a situation in which the other group members had been primed to give obviously wrong answers to a relatively simple problem, and the real participant had to answer openly, after the majority had answered. See bandwagon effect.

This term describes when someone acts the same as everyone else, even though they know they have a different opinion. It's like when you're in a group and you see everyone doing or saying something wrong, but you still do or say the same thing because you don't want to stand out or be different. In a study, people were put in a situation where they had to answer a question, and everyone else purposely gave the wrong answer. Even though the person knew the answer was wrong, they still went along with it because they didn't want to be different from the rest of the group. This is also called the bandwagon effect because it's like jumping on a popular bandwagon even if you don't really agree with it.
