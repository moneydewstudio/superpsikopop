antidepressants is Drugs such as those known as tricyclics, which are used to treat severe depression.

There are some medicines called "tricyclics" that doctors use to help people who are very sad and depressed. These medicines work by affecting some chemicals in the brain that can make a person feel better. They are especially used when the sadness is really strong and makes it hard for someone to do normal everyday things. These medicines can help the person feel happier and more like themselves again.

 

## What are the example case of antidepressants?

1\. "Antidepressant efficacy and side-effect burden: A meta-analysis of data from 42 randomized trials" by Cipriani et al. (2009) - This research analyzed data from 42 randomized trials to assess the overall efficacy and side-effect burden of various antidepressants. The findings provided valuable insights into the comparative effectiveness of different classes of antidepressants.

2\. "Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis" by Cipriani et al. (2018) - This study conducted a comprehensive systematic review and network meta-analysis of 21 antidepressant drugs, comparing their efficacy and acceptability for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder.

3\. "The effectiveness of antidepressants: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 years of antidepressant randomized controlled trials" by Gibbons et al. (2012) - This research examined the effectiveness of antidepressants by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials conducted over a 26-year period. The findings shed light on the long-term effectiveness of antidepressant medications.

4\. "Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction: Incidence, effects, and management" by Kennedy et al. (2016) - This study focused on the incidence, effects, and management of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction, a commonly reported side effect of antidepressant use. The findings provided insights into the magnitude of this problem and potential strategies for mitigating it.

5\. "Antidepressants and the risk of suicide, attempted suicide, and overall mortality in a nationwide cohort" by Coupland et al. (2016) - This large-scale cohort study investigated the association between antidepressant use and the risk of suicide, attempted suicide, and overall mortality. The research aimed to better understand the safety profile of antidepressants in relation to suicide risk.

6\. "Systematic review and expert consensus on the use of antidepressants in epilepsy: What should the clinician know?" by Kanner et al. (2017) - This systematic review and expert consensus paper addressed the use of antidepressants in patients with epilepsy. The research aimed to provide guidance to clinicians regarding the appropriate use of antidepressants in this specific patient population.

These notable research studies have contributed to our understanding of antidepressant efficacy, side effects, long-term effectiveness, sexual dysfunction, suicide risk, and their use in specific patient populations.

 

## What are other terms related to antidepressants?

1\. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): a class of antidepressants that work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which helps improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression.

2\. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): another class of antidepressants that increase the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. They are commonly used to treat depression and certain anxiety disorders.

3\. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): older antidepressant medications that work by blocking the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. They are effective for treating depression but often have more side effects compared to newer antidepressants.

4\. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): a class of antidepressants that increase the levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine by inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase. They are usually prescribed when other antidepressants have not been effective.

5\. Atypical antidepressants: a diverse group of antidepressants that do not fit into the other classes, and they work through various mechanisms. Examples include bupropion, mirtazapine, and trazodone.

6\. Antidepressant withdrawal syndrome: a collection of symptoms that some people may experience when they abruptly stop or reduce their antidepressant medication. Symptoms may include dizziness, irritability, insomnia, flu-like symptoms, and electric shock sensations.

7\. Serotonin syndrome: a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur when there is excessive serotonin accumulation in the brain. It is usually caused by combining certain antidepressants with other medications that also increase serotonin levels. Symptoms include confusion, agitation, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, and fever.

8\. Antidepressant augmentation: a strategy in which additional medications or therapies are added to an existing antidepressant regimen to enhance its effectiveness. This is often done when a patient does not respond adequately to an antidepressant alone.

9\. Antidepressant overdose: taking more than the recommended dose of an antidepressant, which can lead to serious medical complications. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, seizures, cardiac irregularities, and, in severe cases, coma or death.

10\. Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome: a set of symptoms that can occur when a person abruptly stops or rapidly reduces their antidepressant medication. It can include flu-like symptoms, dizziness, headache, irritability, and mood changes.
