> A serious disorder appearing towards the end of infancy, in which the child withdraws from all social contact, which seems to be aversive and distressing. Activity is directed towards inanimate objects and may give evidence of quite high intelligence, but speech is usually minimal. Although it is often called infantile autism, or childhood autism, the condition can persist throughout the persons life. There is little agreement about the cause, although a majority of those who work in the area probably believe in an organic predisposition, and there is even less agreement about treatment. See also theory of mind, broken-mirror theory.

## What is the definition of autism according to Psychologists?

autism is A serious disorder appearing towards the end of infancy, in which the child withdraws from all social contact, which seems to be aversive and distressing. Activity is directed towards inanimate objects and may give evidence of quite high intelligence, but speech is usually minimal. Although it is often called infantile autism, or childhood autism, the condition can persist throughout the persons life. There is little agreement about the cause, although a majority of those who work in the area probably believe in an organic predisposition, and there is even less agreement about treatment. See also theory of mind, broken-mirror theory.

It's a disorder that happens to kids when they are almost done being babies. The child stops wanting to be around other people and prefers to play with objects instead. They might be really smart, but they don't talk much. Some people call it infantile autism or childhood autism, and it can last for the person's whole life. Doctors aren't sure what causes it, but some think it might have to do with how the body works. And there isn't one agreed-upon way to treat it either.
