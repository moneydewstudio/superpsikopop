> A term used in several ways, commonly to describe a deliberate attempt to harm another being. There is no agreed definition, partly because the term is applied sometimes to behaviour (hitting), sometimes to an emotional state (feeling aggressive), and sometimes to an intention (wanting to harm).There are several classifications of different kinds of aggression, the most useful distinction being between instrumental aggression, which is an aggressive act performed in order to achieve some other objective, and hostile aggression, which is motivated by antagonistic feelings and emotions. See also amygdala, trolling.

## What is the definition of aggression according to Psychologists?

aggression is A term used in several ways, commonly to describe a deliberate attempt to harm another being. There is no agreed definition, partly because the term is applied sometimes to behaviour (hitting), sometimes to an emotional state (feeling aggressive), and sometimes to an intention (wanting to harm).There are several classifications of different kinds of aggression, the most useful distinction being between instrumental aggression, which is an aggressive act performed in order to achieve some other objective, and hostile aggression, which is motivated by antagonistic feelings and emotions. See also amygdala, trolling.

Aggression is a word that is used to describe when someone purposely tries to hurt or harm another person or animal. It can mean different things depending on the situation. Sometimes, it refers to physical actions like hitting, while other times it can describe how someone feels inside, like being angry or wanting to hurt someone. It can also be used to talk about someone's intention or desire to cause harm.

There are different types of aggression. One kind is called instrumental aggression, which is when someone behaves aggressively in order to achieve some other goal or objective. For example, someone might push another person to get ahead in line. Another type is called hostile aggression, which is driven by negative feelings and emotions towards someone, such as anger or resentment.

When we talk about aggression, we might also mention the amygdala, which is a part of the brain that is involved in processing emotions, including aggression. Trolling is another term related to aggression, which refers to intentionally provoking or harassing others online.

Overall, aggression is a word used to describe when someone intentionally tries to harm others, and there are different types of aggression depending on the situation and motivation behind it.

 

## What are the example case of aggression?

1\. Bandura's Social Learning Theory - Albert Bandura's research on aggression highlighted the role of observational learning in the acquisition of aggressive behavior. He showed that individuals learn aggressive responses by observing and imitating others.

2\. Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis - Dollard, Doob, Miller, Mowrer, and Sears proposed this hypothesis that suggests aggression is a result of frustration. According to this theory, when individuals are frustrated in reaching their desired goals, aggression may occur as a way to release the built-up frustration.

3\. Biological Perspective on Aggression - Studies have explored the biological factors that contribute to aggression, such as genetics, brain structure, and hormonal influences. Research, including studies on individuals with certain genetic variations or brain abnormalities, has advanced our understanding of the biological basis of aggression.

4\. Social-Information Processing Theory - This theory focuses on how individuals process and interpret social cues, leading to aggressive or non-aggressive responses. Research in this area has highlighted how cognitive processes, such as hostile attribution bias, can influence the occurrence of aggressive behavior.

5\. Media Violence and Aggression - Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between exposure to violent media (e.g., video games, movies, television) and subsequent aggressive behavior. Research has shown evidence of a correlation between exposure to media violence and increased aggression, especially in children and adolescents.

6\. Aggression and Gender - Research has explored gender differences in aggression, highlighting that while both males and females engage in aggressive behavior, there are distinct patterns and contexts. Understanding the role of gender in aggression can help identify factors that contribute to differences and aid in developing targeted interventions.

7\. Aggression and Culture - Cross-cultural research has examined how aggression is expressed and perceived differently in various cultures. This research provides insights into the impact of cultural norms, beliefs, and values on aggression, leading to a better understanding of its role in society.

It is worth noting that the field of aggression research is vast and constantly evolving, with many sub-topics and specialized studies. The above list includes some important and notable research areas, but it is by no means exhaustive.
