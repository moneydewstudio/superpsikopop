## What is the definition of automatisation according to Psychologists?

automatisation is The process of learning a skill or technique so well that it no longer requires conscious thought. See also skill acquisition, automatic routines.

Imagine learning to ride a bicycle for the very first time. At first, you have to think about every single movement  how to balance, how to pedal, and how to steer. It can feel overwhelming and difficult. But as you practice more and more, something amazing happens. Eventually, you reach a point where you can ride your bike without even thinking about it. It becomes automatic. You don't have to concentrate on keeping your balance or pedaling anymore  it just happens naturally. This is called "muscle memory" or "automaticity." It's like your brain gets so used to doing something that it becomes second nature. This can happen with lots of different skills, not just riding a bike. The more you practice and get better at something, the easier it will become, until you can do it without even needing to think about it.
