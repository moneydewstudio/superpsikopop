> Anything that has been constructed. Used particularly about objects that have been made for everyday living by earlier civilisations. Within psychology, the word is most likely to be applied to aspects of data that result from the process of the research and so do not provide any information about the subject of the research, even though they seem to. For example, when patients are interviewed about their experience of hospital treatment, if they are still in hospital with the medical staff around, their reports will be much more positive than when they are at home. So the positivity of the accounts becomes an artefact of the situation.

## What is the definition of artefact (artifact) according to Psychologists?

artefact (artifact) is Anything that has been constructed. Used particularly about objects that have been made for everyday living by earlier civilisations. Within psychology, the word is most likely to be applied to aspects of data that result from the process of the research and so do not provide any information about the subject of the research, even though they seem to. For example, when patients are interviewed about their experience of hospital treatment, if they are still in hospital with the medical staff around, their reports will be much more positive than when they are at home. So the positivity of the accounts becomes an artefact of the situation.

Something that has been built or created. This word is often used to describe things made by people in the past for everyday use. In psychology, the word can also mean information that is not really the main focus of a study, but seems important. For example, if patients are asked about their time in the hospital while they are still there, their answers may be more positive because they are around doctors and nurses. This positive response is not necessarily a true reflection of their actual experience.
