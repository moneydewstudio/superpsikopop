## What is the definition of attentional blink according to Psychologists?

attentional blink is The inability to report a target stimulus if it appears soon after another, reported stimulus. See also selective attention.

This means that sometimes our brain is not able to notice or pay attention to something if it appears right after we have noticed and told others about another thing. It is related to our ability to choose what we pay attention to.

 

## What are the example case of attentional blink?

Below are some notable research studies on attentional blink:

1\. Chun, M. M., & Potter, M. C. (1995). A two-stage model for multiple target detection in rapid serial visual presentation. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 21(1), 109-127. This study proposed the two-stage model of attentional blink, which suggests that target identification occurs in two stages: a pre-attentive identification of potential targets and then a subsequent conscious identification.

2\. Raymond, J. E., Shapiro, K. L., & Arnell, K. M. (1992). Temporary suppression of visual processing in an RSVP task: An attentional blink? Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 18(3), 849-860. This study is one of the earliest to coin the term "attentional blink" and investigate the phenomenon. It found that participants often fail to detect the second target in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task when it appears within about 200-500 milliseconds after the first target.

3\. Shapiro, K. L., Schmitz, J. M., Martens, S., Hommel, B., & Schnitzler, A. (2006). Resource sharing in the attentional blink. Neuroreport, 17(2), 163-166. This study explored the nature of attentional resources during the attentional blink. It suggested that the attentional blink phenomenon could be explained by resource limitation, and that the allocation of attention to the first target temporarily depletes the attentional resources available for processing subsequent stimuli.

4\. Dux, P. E., & Marois, R. (2009). The attentional blink: A review of data and theory. Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics, 71(8), 1683-1700. This comprehensive review paper summarizes various experimental findings and theoretical models related to the attentional blink. It outlines different hypotheses and provides an overview of the state of research in this field.

5\. Nieuwenstein, M. R., & Wyble, B. (2014). Beyond a mask and against the bottleneck: Retroactive dual-task interference during the attentional blink. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 40(6), 2350-2367. This study challenges the traditional bottleneck theory of attentional blink and suggests that retroactive interference from the second task can affect the identification of the first target, leading to attentional blink. It reveals the role of retroactive interference in the attentional blink phenomenon.

These are just a few examples of notable research studies on attentional blink. There are many more studies exploring different aspects of this intriguing cognitive phenomenon.
