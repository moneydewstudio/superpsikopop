## What is the definition of antecedent variables according to Psychologists?

antecedent variables is Factors in an experiment that precede (happen before) some other event. Because of the time relationship, the antecedent variable cannot have been caused by the subsequent event, and may even have been a cause of it. See causality.

An antecedent variable is something that happens before another event in an experiment. It can't be caused by the event that happens after it, and sometimes it might even be the reason that event happens.

 

## What are the example case of antecedent variables?

1) One notable research on antecedent variables is the study conducted by Mowrer and Mowrer (1938), which focused on the antecedent variables of fear conditioning in rats. They found that the presence of a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) were critical antecedent variables for the development and expression of fear responses in the rats.

2) Another significant research on antecedent variables is the study by Bandura, Ross, and Ross (1961), which investigated the antecedent variables contributing to aggressive behavior in children. They demonstrated that the observation of aggressive behavior in adult models served as a significant antecedent variable, leading to imitative aggression in the children.

3) In the domain of educational psychology, the research conducted by Zimmerman (1989) examined the antecedent variables that impact self-regulated learning. The study identified factors such as self-efficacy beliefs, goal setting, and self-monitoring as crucial antecedent variables associated with students' ability to effectively regulate their learning process.

4) In the field of organizational behavior, a notable research on antecedent variables is the study by Hackman and Oldham (1976), who examined the antecedents of work motivation. They proposed a model of job characteristics, including factors such as skill variety, task identity, and feedback, which were identified as significant antecedent variables influencing employee motivation.

5) A notable research on antecedent variables in the field of clinical psychology is the study by Clark and Watson (1991), which explored the antecedents of anxiety and depression. They identified several antecedent variables, such as negative life events, cognitive vulnerability, and family history of mental disorders, that were associated with the development and maintenance of these psychological disorders.

 

## What are other terms related to antecedent variables?

1) Independent variables: These are variables that are manipulated by the researcher in order to observe their effects on the dependent variable.

2) Control variables: These are variables that remain constant or are held constant in a research study to avoid confounding or extraneous effects on the dependent variable.

3) Mediating variables: These variables come in between the antecedent variables and the dependent variable, mediating or explaining the relationship between the two.

4) Moderator variables: These variables influence or modify the strength or direction of the relationship between the antecedent variable and the dependent variable. They can either enhance or weaken the relationship.

5) Confounding variables: These are variables that are not measured or controlled for, but may impact the relationship between the antecedent variable and the dependent variable, leading to inaccurate conclusions.

6) Exogenous variables: These are variables that are external to a system or model, and are not influenced by other variables in the study.

7) Endogenous variables: These are variables that are internal to a system or model, and are influenced by other variables within the study.

8) Predictor variables: These variables are used to predict or forecast the values of the dependent variable, based on their relationship with the antecedent variables.

9) Outcome variables: These are variables that are affected or influenced by the antecedent variables, representing the ultimate result or consequence of the study.

10) Covariate variables: These variables are measured or controlled for in a research study to remove their effects on the relationship between the antecedent variable and the dependent variable.
