## What is the definition of apnoea (apnea) according to Psychologists?

apnoea (apnea) is Temporary stopping of breathing, common among premature babies. It is present in some adults during sleep and is believed to result in the destruction of brain cells through anoxia in extreme cases. Apnoea is often associated with snoring and can result in uncontrollable sleep during the day, so being a cause of road and other accidents.

Temporary stopping of breathing means that for a short time, a person stops taking in air. This can happen more often in babies who were born too early. Sometimes, adults also experience this while they are sleeping. When this happens, it can cause damage to the brain because it doesn't get enough oxygen. In really bad cases, it can even destroy brain cells. Apnoea is often connected to snoring, and it can make a person feel so tired during the day that they can't stay awake. This can be very dangerous because it can lead to accidents, like car crashes.

 

## What are the example case of apnoea (apnea)?

1\. "Obstructive sleep apnea: a new cardiovascular risk factor" - This research study explores the association between sleep apnea and cardiovascular diseases. It highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

2\. "The impact of sleep apnea on glucose metabolism and diabetes" - This research investigates the link between sleep apnea and impaired glucose metabolism, including the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. It emphasizes the need for adequate sleep quality and the management of sleep apnea in individuals with glucose intolerance.

3\. "Effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for sleep apnea" - This study examines the benefits of CPAP therapy, the most common treatment for sleep apnea. It demonstrates the significant improvement in symptoms, quality of life, and reduction in cardiovascular risk factors after using CPAP consistently.

4\. "Pediatric sleep apnea: impact on growth and cognitive development" - This research focuses on the consequences of sleep apnea in children. It highlights how untreated sleep apnea can affect growth, cognitive development, and behavior in children. Finding effective treatment and early intervention are emphasized.

5\. "Genetic basis of sleep apnea" - This study aims to identify specific genetic markers contributing to the development of sleep apnea. It investigates the genetic factors involved in different types of sleep apnea, helping to better understand its underlying causes and develop targeted therapies.

6\. "Sleep apnea and neurocognitive impairment in the elderly" - This research examines the impact of sleep apnea on cognitive function, memory, and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in older adults. It emphasizes the role of sleep apnea as a potentially reversible contributor to cognitive decline and dementia.

7\. "Impact of sleep apnea on mental health" - This study investigates the association between sleep apnea and mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and impaired quality of life. It sheds light on the importance of treating sleep apnea as a crucial component in managing mental health conditions.

8\. "Link between sleep apnea and stroke" - This research explores the relationship between sleep apnea and stroke risk. It highlights the increased likelihood of stroke in individuals with untreated sleep apnea, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and intervention to reduce stroke incidence.

9\. "Effect of weight loss on sleep apnea severity" - This study assesses the impact of weight loss interventions, such as diet and exercise, on sleep apnea severity. It recognizes weight loss as an effective means to improve sleep apnea symptoms and reduce the need for invasive treatments like surgery.

10\. "Sleep apnea in pregnancy: implications for maternal and fetal health" - This research investigates the effects of sleep apnea on pregnant women and their unborn babies. It identifies the risks and complications associated with sleep apnea during pregnancy and emphasizes the importance of proper diagnosis and management to ensure optimal maternal and fetal health.

 

## What are other terms related to apnoea (apnea)?

1\. Sleep apnea: Sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, often accompanied by loud snoring. 2. Obstructive sleep apnea: The most common form of sleep apnea, it occurs when the throat muscles intermittently relax and block the airway while asleep. 3. Central sleep apnea: A rarer form of sleep apnea, it happens when the brain fails to transmit proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. 4. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): A metric used to measure the severity of sleep apnea by counting the number of apnea and hypopnea episodes per hour during sleep. 5. Hypopnea: Partial blockage or narrowing of the airway resulting in shallow breathing or a reduction in airflow. 6. Nocturnal hypoventilation: Insufficient breathing during sleep, leading to excessive carbon dioxide levels in the blood. 7. Snoring: The loud, hoarse or harsh sound produced during sleep due to the vibration of the airway structures. 8. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): A common treatment for sleep apnea that involves wearing a mask over the nose or mouth to deliver a continuous flow of air pressure, preventing the airway from collapsing. 9. Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP): Similar to CPAP, but with two different pressure levels, higher during inhalation and lower during exhalation. 10. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP): A surgical procedure to remove excess tissues in the throat and/or palate that may contribute to sleep apnea.
