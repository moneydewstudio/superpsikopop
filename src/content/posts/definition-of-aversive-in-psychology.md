## What is the definition of aversive according to Psychologists?

aversive is Leading to avoidance behaviour. A stimulus or event that is unpleasant (such as an electrical shock) would be described as aversive.

Sometimes, when something happens to us that we don't like or find unpleasant, we try to stay away from it. This is called avoidance behavior. For example, if we receive an electrical shock, that experience would be described as an aversive event because it's something we don't want to happen again. So, when something bad or uncomfortable happens, we tend to try and avoid it to keep ourselves safe and happy.
