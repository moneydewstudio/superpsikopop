## What is the definition of autistic according to Psychologists?

autistic is Thought and fantasy determined entirely by the persons needs and wishes and not constrained by reality in any way. Daydreams are autistic, as is the isolation from immediate social contact through the absorbed use of iPhones and portable music, but the term is usually reserved for the more extreme and permanent removal from reality, such as is found in schizophrenic thought, and is characteristic of some conspiracy theories.

Sometimes, people have thoughts and imagine things that are not real and not based on what is happening around them. This is called daydreaming. It is like being lost in your own world. For example, when someone is using their iPhone or listening to music through headphones, they might be so focused on that, they can't really pay attention to what's happening around them. However, there is a more serious condition called schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia have thoughts and beliefs that are very different from what most people think. They might have ideas that others might find strange or unbelievable. It's like they are living in a different reality. This is not the same as daydreaming. Schizophrenia is a mental illness that requires medical help. Some people also believe in conspiracy theories. These are ideas that suggest powerful groups are secretly controlling things or hiding important information. These theories can also be considered as living in a different reality. However, it is important to note that not all people who believe in conspiracy theories have a mental illness.
