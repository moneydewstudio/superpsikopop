## What is the definition of achievement motivation according to Psychologists?

achievement motivation is The motivation to accomplish valued goals and to avoid failure. This concept became important in the 1960s as motivation theory became less dominated by physiological drives. It was generally studied as need for achievement, commonly abbreviated to nAch. See also need for affiliation, motivation.

The motivation to accomplish valued goals and avoid failure means that you have a strong desire to achieve the things that are important to you and to avoid any negative outcomes or setbacks. This idea became important in the 1960s when scientists started focusing more on why people are motivated rather than just looking at physical needs like hunger or being tired. They started studying the need for achievement, which is often referred to as nAch, and it's about how strong your desire is to accomplish things. Another related concept is the need for affiliation, which is how much you seek social connections and relationships. So, motivation is all about what drives us to reach our goals and avoid failure.

 

## What are the example case of achievement motivation?

One of the most notable research studies on achievement motivation is the work of Carol Dweck, a psychologist known for her research on mindset and its impact on achievement. Dweck's groundbreaking research identified two types of mindsets: fixed mindset and growth mindset.

In her classic study, Dweck and her colleagues found that individuals with a fixed mindset believe their abilities are fixed traits that cannot be improved. On the other hand, individuals with a growth mindset believe that abilities can be developed through hard work, strategies, and learning from failures.

The research demonstrated that individuals with a growth mindset tend to have higher achievement motivation. They are more likely to set challenging goals, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a path to mastery. Those with a fixed mindset, however, are more focused on proving their abilities and avoiding failure rather than learning and growth.

This research has significant implications for education, parenting, and organizational settings. It suggests that fostering a growth mindset can enhance achievement motivation and lead to increased effort, resilience, and overall performance. Dweck's work has influenced numerous studies and interventions aiming to cultivate a growth mindset to promote achievement motivation in individuals of all ages and backgrounds.
