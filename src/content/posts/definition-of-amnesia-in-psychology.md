> Loss of memory, normally from physical causes. Retrograde amnesia refers to loss of memory for events prior to the damaging event or disease; loss of memory of the few minutes leading up to severe concussion is the most common example. Anterograde amnesia refers to the loss of subsequent memory (e.g. impairment of the ability to code new memories after brain surgery or, as found in Korsakoffs syndrome, through long-term alcoholism).

## What is the definition of amnesia according to Psychologists?

amnesia is Loss of memory, normally from physical causes. Retrograde amnesia refers to loss of memory for events prior to the damaging event or disease; loss of memory of the few minutes leading up to severe concussion is the most common example. Anterograde amnesia refers to the loss of subsequent memory (e.g. impairment of the ability to code new memories after brain surgery or, as found in Korsakoffs syndrome, through long-term alcoholism).

Loss of memory can happen for different reasons. Retrograde amnesia means you can't remember things that happened before something bad happened to your brain or body. For example, if you have a really bad head injury, you might not remember anything that happened before the injury. Another example is when people can't remember the few minutes right before they get a really hard hit to the head.

Anterograde amnesia is when you can't make new memories after a certain event. So, if you have brain surgery, you might have trouble remembering things that happened after the surgery. This can also happen in people who drink a lot of alcohol for a long time, called Korsakoff's syndrome. They might have trouble remembering new things because of their drinking habit.

 

## What are the example case of amnesia?

One of the most important and notable research studies regarding the term "amodal" is the work done by Stephen Kosslyn and colleagues in the field of cognitive science. These researchers have contributed significantly to the understanding of amodal perception  which refers to the ability to perceive and represent objects in a way that is not tied to a specific sensory modality (e.g., visual, auditory, etc.).

In their influential paper titled "The Case for Mental Imagery" (1978), Kosslyn and colleagues conducted a series of experiments to support the idea that imagery in the mind can involve multiple modalities. They argued that mental images are not tied to a specific sensory modality and proposed the concept of a "depictive representation." This representation allows mental images to be similar to perceiving the external world directly, bypassing sensory receptors.

Additionally, Kosslyn's subsequent work with his colleagues, such as in their research on visual mental imagery (e.g., "Mental Imagery and the Verbalization of Visual Images: A PET Study" - 1993), further contributed to the understanding of how amodal representations can be formed and manipulated within the brain.

Overall, the research conducted by Kosslyn and colleagues has significantly advanced our understanding of amodal perception and its role in mental imagery. These studies have had a lasting impact on the field of cognitive science and have paved the way for further investigations into the nature of amodal representations.

 

## What are other terms related to amnesia?

Amnesia: A condition characterized by the loss or disruption of memory, typically resulting from brain injury, trauma, or disease.

Anterograde amnesia: A type of amnesia where a person is unable to form new memories after the onset of the condition.

Retrograde amnesia: A type of amnesia where a person is unable to recall events that occurred before the onset of the condition.

Selective amnesia: A form of amnesia where certain memories or information are consciously or unconsciously blocked or forgotten.

Post-traumatic amnesia: A temporary period of memory loss following a traumatic event, usually involving head injury, which can include confusion, disorientation, and inability to recall events.

Transient global amnesia: A sudden and temporary episode of memory loss, usually lasting a few hours, with an unknown cause.

Psychogenic amnesia: An uncommon type of amnesia that results from psychological factors, such as severe stress or trauma, and is often a way for a person to cope with highly distressing events.

Dissociative amnesia: A type of amnesia characterized by the inability to recall personal information and significant autobiographical events, often associated with dissociative disorders.

Drug-induced amnesia: Memory impairment resulting from the use of certain medications or substances that can interfere with the formation, storage, or retrieval of memories.

Hysterical amnesia: A type of amnesia that occurs due to psychological factors and is often associated with individuals experiencing a high level of emotional stress or trauma.

Concussion-related amnesia: Memory loss or impairment that occurs as a result of a concussion, a type of traumatic brain injury, often accompanied by temporary disorientation and confusion.

Source amnesia: A type of amnesia where a person remembers a piece of information but forgets where or how they obtained it.

Functional amnesia: A rare form of amnesia where there is no identifiable organic or physical cause, and the memory loss is typically selective and restricted to a specific period or information.

Childhood amnesia: The normal and natural inability to recall or remember early childhood events or experiences, typically before the age of three or four.

Infantile amnesia: The inability to remember events and experiences from infancy, often extending up to the age of three or four years old.
