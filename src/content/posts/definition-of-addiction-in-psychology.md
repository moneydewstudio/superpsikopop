> A state of physiological or psychological dependence on some substance, usually a drug, resulting in tolerance of that substance such that progressively larger doses are required to obtain the same effect. Addictions are most clearly identified by a failure to function adequately when the substance is withdrawn (see withdrawal symptoms). The most common addictions are to nicotine and to socially accepted drugs such as alcohol and caffeine, although illegal drugs (e.g. heroin) and those initially taken as medical treatment (e.g. tranquillisers) often cause more public concern. Treatments have covered the full range of psychological and psychiatric techniques but behavioural and group methods are most widely used. In everyday use, the term has been stretched to include needs which have become exaggerated to a degree that is damaging to the individual (e.g. addiction to television, violent exercise or food). See also dependency.

## What is the definition of addiction according to Psychologists?

addiction is A state of physiological or psychological dependence on some substance, usually a drug, resulting in tolerance of that substance such that progressively larger doses are required to obtain the same effect. Addictions are most clearly identified by a failure to function adequately when the substance is withdrawn (see withdrawal symptoms). The most common addictions are to nicotine and to socially accepted drugs such as alcohol and caffeine, although illegal drugs (e.g. heroin) and those initially taken as medical treatment (e.g. tranquillisers) often cause more public concern. Treatments have covered the full range of psychological and psychiatric techniques but behavioural and group methods are most widely used. In everyday use, the term has been stretched to include needs which have become exaggerated to a degree that is damaging to the individual (e.g. addiction to television, violent exercise or food). See also dependency.

Addiction is when someone becomes dependent on a substance, like a drug, and needs more and more of it to feel the same effect. They may also have trouble functioning normally when they don't have the substance anymore, which can cause withdrawal symptoms. The most common addictions are to things like cigarettes, alcohol, and caffeine. Some drugs that are illegal or used for medical reasons can also cause addiction. People have tried many different ways to help with addiction, but behavioral and group methods are often used the most. In everyday life, addiction has been used to describe when someone becomes overly obsessed with something, like watching too much TV, exercising too much, or eating too much.

 

## What are the example case of addiction?

1\. Griffiths, M. D. (2005). A components model of addiction within a biopsychosocial framework. Journal of Substance Use, 10(4), 191-197.

This research paper proposed a comprehensive model of addiction known as the "components" model. The model suggests that addiction consists of six interconnected components: mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, conflict, relapse, and salience. This paper provided a useful framework for understanding the multifaceted nature of addiction.

2\. Koob, G. F., & Volkow, N. D. (2010). Neurocircuitry of addiction. Neuropsychopharmacology, 35(1), 217-238.

This paper highlights the neurobiological mechanisms underlying addiction. It explains how addictive substances and behaviors can hijack the brain's reward system, leading to compulsive drug use. Understanding the neural circuits involved in addiction has significant implications for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.

3\. Duhigg, C. (2012). The power of habit: Why we do what we do in life and business. Random House.

Although not a research paper, this book by Charles Duhigg provides valuable insights into the behavioral and psychological aspects of addiction. It explores the role of habits and routines in addiction development and recovery. The book emphasizes the importance of understanding habit loops and the ability to reshape them for successful addiction treatment.

4\. Volkow, N. D., Fowler, J. S., & Wang, G. J. (2003). The addicted human brain: insights from imaging studies. Journal of Clinical Investigation, 111(10), 1444-1451.

This research review focuses on the neuroimaging studies conducted on individuals with addiction. It demonstrates the changes that occur in the brain's structure and function due to long-term substance abuse. The findings help elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying addiction and aid in developing targeted interventions.

5\. American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). American Psychiatric Pub.

Although not a research paper, the DSM-5 is a widely recognized and influential diagnostic manual in the field of mental health. It provides a comprehensive classification and diagnostic criteria for addiction disorders. By defining addiction as a mental disorder, this manual has played a crucial role in shaping research, treatment approaches, and insurance coverage for addiction-related conditions.

 

## What are other terms related to addiction?

Compulsion: Individuals with addiction often feel a strong and uncontrollable urge to engage in the addictive substance or behavior. This compulsion is a central feature of addiction.

Loss of Control: One of the defining characteristics of addiction is the loss of control over the substance or behavior. Despite negative consequences, individuals may find it challenging to stop or moderate their engagement.

Tolerance: Over time, individuals with addiction may develop tolerance, requiring larger amounts of the substance or increased engagement in the behavior to achieve the desired effect.

Withdrawal: When not engaging in the addictive substance or behavior, individuals may experience withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can be both physical and psychological and contribute to the cycle of addiction.

Negative Consequences: Addiction often leads to adverse consequences in various areas of life, such as relationships, work, health, and overall well-being.

Biopsychosocial Factors: The development of addiction is influenced by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. Genetic predisposition, mental health conditions, environmental stressors, and social influences can all play a role.

Substance Addiction: This includes dependencies on substances such as alcohol, nicotine, prescription medications, or illegal drugs.

Behavioral Addiction: This involves compulsive engagement in specific behaviors, such as gambling, gaming, shopping, or eating, despite negative consequences.

Treatment Approaches: Addiction is considered a treatable condition. Treatment may involve a combination of behavioral therapies, counseling, support groups, and, in some cases, medications to address underlying issues or manage withdrawal symptoms.

Relapse: Addiction is often characterized by a tendency to relapse, even after periods of abstinence. Relapse does not indicate failure but underscores the chronic nature of addiction and the need for ongoing support.
