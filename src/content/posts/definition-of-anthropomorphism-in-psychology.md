> The process of attributing human characteristics to non-human objects or animals. Anthropomorphism, while accepted as a scientific fallacy, is common to all human societies: even in modern technological cultures, it is common for human beings to attribute intention (either benign or malevolent) to the actions of computers, spiders, etc. See also attribution, animism, social representations, Lloyd Morgans canon.

## What is the definition of anthropomorphism according to Psychologists?

anthropomorphism is The process of attributing human characteristics to non-human objects or animals. Anthropomorphism, while accepted as a scientific fallacy, is common to all human societies: even in modern technological cultures, it is common for human beings to attribute intention (either benign or malevolent) to the actions of computers, spiders, etc. See also attribution, animism, social representations, Lloyd Morgans canon.

Anthropomorphism means giving human-like qualities to things that are not humans, like objects or animals. Even though it's considered a scientific mistake, people from all societies do it. This means that even in today's modern societies, we often think that things like computers or spiders have intentions, like being nice or mean. Other related terms to anthropomorphism are attribution, animism, social representations, and Lloyd Morgan's canon.

 

## What are the example case of anthropomorphism?

1\. Epley, N., Waytz, A., & Cacioppo, J. T. (2007). On seeing human: A three-factor theory of anthropomorphism. Psychological Review, 114(4), 864-886. This study proposes a three-factor theory of anthropomorphism, suggesting that people interpret stimuli (objects or events) as humanlike based on their perceived agentiveness, experience of social interaction, and application of human psychological characteristics.

2\. Waytz, A., & Epley, N. (2014). What does it mean to be "like a child"? Discerning the boundary conditions for applying the concept of the human child to nonhuman entities. Developmental Psychology, 50(1), 145-153. This research explores how people attribute childlike qualities to nonhuman entities and investigates the factors that influence this tendency, highlighting the role of perceived vulnerability and dependence.

3\. Waytz, A., Heafner, J., & Epley, N. (2014). The mind in the machine: Anthropomorphism increases trust in an autonomous vehicle. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 52, 113-117. This study examines how anthropomorphism affects trust in autonomous vehicles. Findings indicate that when an autonomous vehicle is anthropomorphized, individuals are more likely to trust it and feel safe.

4\. Friedman, B., Kahn Jr, P. H., & Borning, A. (2000). Value sensitive design and information systems. Human-computer interaction in management information systems: Foundations, 348-372. This research explores value-sensitive design, which is an approach that aims to integrate human values into the design of technology. It considers the potential implications of anthropomorphism in information systems and the importance of ethical considerations.

5\. Waytz, A., Monteleone, G., & Ginges, J. (2012). Not all fairness is equal: Fairness perceptions of voice and power are uniquely associated with agonistic and communal behavioral responses. Psychological Science, 23(6), 661-668. This study investigates how anthropomorphism affects individuals' perceptions of fairness and their subsequent behavioral responses. It suggests that when people anthropomorphize others, their judgments of fairness vary based on the perceived voice and power of the entity.

6\. Aggarwal, P., & McGill, A. L. (2007). Is that car smiling at me? Schema congruity as a basis for evaluating anthropomorphized products. Journal of Consumer Research, 34(4), 468-479. This research examines how consumers' evaluation of anthropomorphized products (e.g., cars with expressive front-end designs) is influenced by the congruity between their schemas (mental frameworks) and the product's appearance. It sheds light on the impact of anthropomorphism on consumer behavior.

These are just a few notable research studies on the topic of anthropomorphism. The field is continually evolving, and numerous other studies have been conducted in various domains, including psychology, marketing, human-computer interaction, and ethics.
