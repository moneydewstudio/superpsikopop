> The presence in one person (either male or female) of both male and female characteristics. In humans, there are no sex differences that are present in one gender and not the other  it is more a matter of the prevalence and strength of each tendency. Therefore, everybody mixes male and female characteristics to some extent, and the term androgyny is reserved for people who show both male and female characteristics to a significant degree. Research indicates that individuals who are psychologically androgynous tend to be mentally healthier than those who conform tightly to orthodox gender stereotypes.

## What is the definition of androgyny according to Psychologists?

androgyny is The presence in one person (either male or female) of both male and female characteristics. In humans, there are no sex differences that are present in one gender and not the other  it is more a matter of the prevalence and strength of each tendency. Therefore, everybody mixes male and female characteristics to some extent, and the term androgyny is reserved for people who show both male and female characteristics to a significant degree. Research indicates that individuals who are psychologically androgynous tend to be mentally healthier than those who conform tightly to orthodox gender stereotypes.

Androgyny means when someone has both boy and girl qualities. In boys, it means they have some girl qualities and in girls, it means they have some boy qualities. Everyone has a mix of these qualities, but some people have a lot of both. Being androgynous is when someone has a lot of both boy and girl qualities.

Studies show that people who are androgynous are usually mentally healthier than people who only act like boys or only act like girls.

\- Androgyny: Refers to the combination of masculine and feminine characteristics or qualities in an individual. Androgynous individuals do not conform to traditional gender stereotypes and can exhibit both masculine and feminine traits.

Example sentence: The concept of androgyny challenges society's narrow understanding of gender roles, promoting the acceptance of individuals who fall outside the binary definitions of masculinity and femininity.

\- Self-fulfilling prophecy: A belief or expectation that leads an individual to act in a way that, in turn, brings about the expected outcome. This phenomenon occurs when a person's belief about himself or herself influences their behavior, which then confirms the initial belief.

Example sentence: The self-fulfilling prophecy explains how a student who believes they are academically incapable may perform poorly because they do not put in the effort required to succeed, ultimately confirming their initial belief.

\- Cognitive dissonance: A state of psychological discomfort that arises when an individual's beliefs, attitudes, or values conflict with each other or with their actions. This internal conflict motivates individuals to reduce the discomfort by either changing their beliefs or justifying their actions.

Example sentence: Cognitive dissonance can be observed when a person who values health and well-being continues to engage in unhealthy behaviors, leading to a sense of conflict that needs resolving.

\- Learned helplessness: A psychological state in which an individual feels powerless and unable to control or influence their situations or outcomes, often due to experiencing repeated negative events or failures. Learned helplessness can lead to a passive attitude and a belief that one's actions will not make a difference.

Example sentence: People who have endured prolonged abuse or difficult life circumstances may develop learned helplessness, perceiving themselves as victims and feeling incapable of breaking free from their situation.

\- Socialization: The process through which individuals acquire the values, norms, beliefs, and behaviors of a particular society or culture. It involves learning the appropriate ways to think, feel, and behave within a given social group.

Example sentence: Family, peers, and media influence play significant roles in the socialization process, shaping an individual's personality, attitudes, and behavior patterns.
