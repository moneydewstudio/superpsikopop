## What is the definition of ambivert according to Psychologists?

ambivert is A person who has achieved a balance between extreme introversion and extreme extraversion, as described by Eysenck.

Imagine someone who used to be extremely shy and quiet, rarely interacting with others, but now they have found a way to be more outgoing and sociable. They have found a middle ground between being extremely introverted and extremely extroverted. They still value their alone time and enjoy being by themselves, but they also now feel comfortable being around others and engaging in social activities. They have become more balanced in their approach to socializing and have found a happy medium between being too withdrawn and being too outgoing.
