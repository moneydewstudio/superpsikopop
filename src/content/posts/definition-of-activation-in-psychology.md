## What is the definition of activation according to Psychologists?

activation is An increase in neurological or physiological processing in one condition, relative to other conditions, or the stimulation of neural pathways. See also deactivation.

"Neurological or physiological processing" refers to how our brain and body work together to process information and perform tasks. It's like our brain's way of thinking and our body's way of doing things.

"Stimulation of neural pathways" means when we engage our brains and make the connections between different parts of our brain stronger. It's like building new roads in our brain to let information travel faster and more easily.

"An increase in neurological or physiological processing in one condition, relative to other conditions" simply means that in a specific situation or compared to other situations, our brain and body are working harder and faster to process information.

"Deactivation" means when certain parts of our brain stop or reduce their activity. It's like temporarily shutting down certain regions of our brain that aren't needed at the moment.

 

## What are the example case of activation?

One of the most important and notable research studies concerning activation is the research on the activation theory of information processing by Robert D. Norman and Sona Dimidjian. This theory focuses on how activation levels in the brain affect the processing and retrieval of information.

According to the activation theory, individuals need an optimal level of arousal to effectively process and retrieve information. Too little or too much arousal can result in decreased cognitive performance. The study conducted by Norman and Dimidjian examined how variables like attention, arousal, and information processing affect activation levels.

The researchers found that individuals with higher levels of activation tend to have enhanced cognitive performance and improved attention. They also discovered that factors such as stress, fatigue, and external distractions can play a role in reducing activation levels, leading to impaired performance.

This research laid the groundwork for understanding how activation affects information processing and the importance of maintaining an optimal level of arousal for cognitive functioning. It has significantly influenced the field of cognitive psychology and has been further expanded upon by subsequent studies in various domains, including attention, memory, and decision-making.
