## What is the definition of anomaly according to Psychologists?

anomaly is A noticeable deviation from what is expected or predicted.

An obvious difference from what was supposed to happen or what people thought would happen.

 

## What are the example case of anomaly?

5\. "Thermal anomalies in coral reefs: Potential indicators of coral bleaching events" by Punyasloke Bhadury, et al. (2017) - This research investigates the use of thermal anomalies to predict and monitor coral bleaching events in coral reef ecosystems. It explores the relationship between sea surface temperature anomalies and coral bleaching, highlighting the potential for remote sensing techniques to aid in the conservation and management of coral reefs.

These notable research studies provide insights into the detection, analysis, and applications of thermal anomalies in various domains, including geological, environmental, and building sciences.

 

## What are other terms related to anomaly?

1\. Deviation: Refers to a departure or divergence from the normal or expected state or behavior. 2. Abnormality: Describes something that is outside the range of what is considered usual or typical. 3. Irregularity: Signifies a lack of regularity or consistency, often suggesting deviation from a pattern or norm. 4. Outlier: Denotes a data point or observation that significantly deviates from the rest of the data set, often considered atypical or unusual. 5. Oddity: Refers to something that is strange, peculiar, or unconventional, deviating from what is customary. 6. Quirk: Describes a peculiar or idiosyncratic behavior or characteristic that deviates from the norm, often seen as unique or unusual. 7. Eccentricity: Refers to unconventional or peculiar behavior, often associated with someone who is considered odd or peculiar compared to societal norms. 8. Noteworthy: Denotes something that stands out or is remarkable due to its distinctiveness or peculiarity, often considered an anomaly within a larger context.
