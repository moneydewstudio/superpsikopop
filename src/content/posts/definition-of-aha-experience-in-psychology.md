## What is the definition of aha! experience according to Psychologists?

aha! experience is A sudden experience of enlightenment, in which the solution to a problem is perceived very rapidly, with little prior feeling that progress is being made towards the solution. An example of insight learning, the aha! experience was used by Gestalt theorists such as Kohler to argue against the reductionist approach to human learning put forward by the behaviourist school. See also creativity.

A sudden moment of understanding or realization, where you figure out the answer to a problem really quickly, even though it didn't feel like you were making progress before. It's like a light bulb switching on in your head. This type of learning is called insight learning, and it goes against the idea that humans only learn through repetitive behaviors, according to a theory by Gestalt psychologists like Kohler.
