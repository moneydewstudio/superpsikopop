> An object or phenomenon that corresponds to or resembles another in at least some respects. The term is used: (i) in theories of memory referring to information stored in the brain from which a representation or image of an object can be generated; (ii) in biology for different characteristics of different species that have the same functions; and (iii) in electronics for information shown through a continuously variable quantity, such as analogue (circular) clock faces as opposed to digital watches.

## What is the definition of analogue according to Psychologists?

analogue is An object or phenomenon that corresponds to or resembles another in at least some respects. The term is used: (i) in theories of memory referring to information stored in the brain from which a representation or image of an object can be generated; (ii) in biology for different characteristics of different species that have the same functions; and (iii) in electronics for information shown through a continuously variable quantity, such as analogue (circular) clock faces as opposed to digital watches.

An analogy is when two things are similar in some ways. It can be used to talk about memory, when the brain remembers something and can create a picture. It can also be used in biology, when different species have similar features that serve the same purpose. And in electronics, it refers to information displayed with a continuously moving quantity, like a round clock instead of a digital watch.

 

## What are the example case of analogue?

One of the most important and notable research related to the term "analogue" is the study of analogue models in geology and earth sciences. Analogue models are physical, scaled-down representations of geological processes and structures used to understand various aspects of Earth's evolution. Some notable research in this area include:

1\. James Thomson's experiments on folding and faulting (1856): Thomson's experiments with layered materials provided the first analogue models of folding and faulting, helping to understand the deformation of rocks.

2\. Harry Hess's seafloor spreading model (1960): Hess proposed the concept of seafloor spreading as an analogue for the mechanism behind continental drift. This research was instrumental in developing the theory of plate tectonics.

3\. Claude Allègre's experiments on convection in the Earth's mantle (1980s): Allègre conducted analogue experiments using fluids to understand the convective processes occurring in the Earth's mantle, contributing to our understanding of mantle dynamics and plate tectonics.

4\. Daniel McKenzie and Mike Bickle's experiments on sedimentary basin formation (1988): McKenzie and Bickle's research involved analogue models simulating the processes of sedimentation and basin formation. Their work helped to unravel the complex processes responsible for the evolution of sedimentary basins.

5\. Stephan Sobolev and Alexey Sukharev's experiments on magma ascent (2000): Sobolev and Sukharev used analogue models involving molten wax to study the behavior of magma rising through the Earth's crust. This research provided insights into volcanic eruptions and the formation of igneous rock structures.

These studies utilizing analogue models have greatly enhanced our understanding of various geological processes and have played a crucial role in the advancement of earth sciences.

 

## What are other terms related to analogue?

1\. Analogical Reasoning: A cognitive process where individuals use prior knowledge or experiences to solve new problems or make sense of new information.

2\. Analogous Structures: In neuroscience, analogous structures refer to similar brain regions or systems in different species that serve similar functions.

3\. Analogous Thinking: A cognitive process where individuals use analogies or comparisons to understand or explain complex concepts or ideas.

4\. Analogous Phenomenon: Similar psychological experiences or phenomena observed in different individuals or situations.

5\. Analogous Behaviors: Similar actions or responses exhibited by individuals in different contexts or circumstances, often reflecting underlying psychological processes or motivations.
