## What is the definition of Amphetamine according to Psychologists?

Amphetamine is A drug that stimulates the central nervous system. It is usually prescribed in order to raise energy levels or to prevent sleep and is abused (e.g. as speed) for the same purposes. Amphetamine is also used as an appetite suppressant to help dieters and to control hyperactive children.

Amphetamine is a type of medicine that makes your brain and body work faster. Doctors usually give it to people who need more energy or have trouble staying awake. But some people misuse it, like using it as a drug called 'speed,' to get more energy or stay awake for longer periods of time. Amphetamine can also be used by people trying to lose weight because it reduces their appetite. Additionally, it can be used to help kids who have a hard time sitting still and staying focused.

## What are other terms related to Amphetamine?

Amphetamine: A central nervous system stimulant drug that is used mainly for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It works by increasing the levels of certain chemicals in the brain that help with focus, attention, and impulse control.

Methamphetamine: A highly addictive stimulant drug that is chemically similar to amphetamine. It is typically illicitly produced and used as a recreational drug, known commonly as meth or crystal meth.

Dextroamphetamine: A type of amphetamine that is used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. It works by increasing the levels of certain chemicals in the brain to improve attention span, decrease hyperactivity, and control impulsive behavior.

Adderall: A prescription medication that contains a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine salts. It is commonly used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy, and helps to improve focus, attention, and impulse control.

Ritalin: A brand name for the medication methylphenidate, which is often used to treat ADHD. Although it is not an amphetamine, it works similarly by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain to improve attention and decrease hyperactivity.

Vyvanse: A prescription medication that contains the active ingredient lisdexamfetamine. It is used to treat ADHD and binge eating disorder. Vyvanse is a prodrug, meaning it is converted into dextroamphetamine in the body and provides a steady and extended release of the active drug.

Concerta: A brand name for a medication called methylphenidate extended-release. It is used to treat ADHD and works by gradually releasing the active ingredient over an extended period of time, providing a prolonged effect.

Stimulant: A substance that increases activity or arousal in the central nervous system, leading to heightened alertness, elevated mood, and increased energy. Amphetamines are classified as stimulant drugs.

Dopamine: A neurotransmitter in the brain that plays a key role in reward, motivation, pleasure, and movement. Amphetamines increase the release and inhibit the reuptake of dopamine, contributing to their stimulant effects.

Noradrenaline (norepinephrine): A neurotransmitter that is involved in regulating alertness, attention, and stress response. Amphetamines can increase the release and inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline in the brain.

Neurotransmitter: Chemical messengers in the brain that transmit signals between nerve cells. Dopamine and noradrenaline are examples of neurotransmitters involved in the effects of amphetamine.

Tolerance: A phenomenon where the body becomes less responsive to the effects of a drug over time, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect. Long-term use of amphetamines can lead to tolerance.

Withdrawal: The uncomfortable and sometimes negative physical and psychological symptoms that occur when a drug dependent person stops using a substance. Amphetamine withdrawal symptoms may include fatigue, depression, irritability, and increased appetite.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): A neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with functioning or development. Amphetamines are frequently prescribed to manage ADHD symptoms.

Narcolepsy: A chronic sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden and uncontrollable sleep attacks, cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone), and disrupted nighttime sleep. Amphetamines are used as a treatment option for narcolepsy.
