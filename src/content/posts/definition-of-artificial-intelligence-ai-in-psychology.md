> An area of research which aims to develop computer systems that will allow the computer to develop novel solutions to problems, or to produce other forms of intelligent behaviour such as gathering relevant information to aid expert decisions. It is hoped by those involved that computer systems which can reason will eventually be able to produce the same kinds of outcomes as those produced by human cognitive processes. Work on artificial intelligence has tended to concentrate on: (i) knowledge-based systems, known as expert systems, which are capable of limited decision-making on the basis of prior input from a number of human experts; (ii) humanmachine interface research, such as the development of voice recognition systems; and (iii) robotics, involving the development of sensing and manipulation devices such as might be suitable for manufacturing processes.See also computer simulation, parallel distributed processing.

## What is the definition of artificial intelligence (AI) according to Psychologists?

artificial intelligence (AI) is An area of research which aims to develop computer systems that will allow the computer to develop novel solutions to problems, or to produce other forms of intelligent behaviour such as gathering relevant information to aid expert decisions.

Artificial intelligence is a type of research that tries to make computers act smart and solve problems like humans do. Scientists want computers to be able to gather helpful information and make good decisions, just like experts do. They hope that computers with "reasoning" abilities will be able to do the same things our brains can do. There are three main areas that researchers focus on in artificial intelligence:

1\. Expert systems: These are computer programs that make choices based on what humans have taught them. They can only make limited decisions, but they are helpful for things like giving advice or making predictions.

2\. Human-machine interface research: This involves making computers understand and respond to human voices. It's important because it makes it easier for people to talk to computers and get answers or give commands.

3\. Robotics: This field is about creating machines that can sense things and move objects. It's useful for tasks like making things in factories.

Overall, artificial intelligence is about trying to make computers act smart and do things that humans can do.

 

## What are the example case of artificial intelligence (AI)?

1\. Deep Blue: Developed by IBM, Deep Blue became the first computer to defeat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, in May 1997. This breakthrough demonstrated AI's capability to compete against human intelligence in complex strategic games.

2\. AlphaGo: Developed by Google DeepMind, AlphaGo is an AI program that gained fame for defeating the world champion Go player, Lee Sedol, in March 2016. This achievement showed how AI could master a highly complex game with immense possibilities and strategic depth.

3\. GPT-3: Developed by OpenAI, GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a language processing AI model released in June 2020. With 175 billion parameters, GPT-3 has set new benchmarks in natural language understanding, generating human-like text, and performing a wide range of language-related tasks.

4\. ImageNet: ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of labeled images created to advance image recognition technology. It played a pivotal role in the development of deep learning algorithms and was instrumental in the success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks.

5\. Watson: Developed by IBM, Watson is a question-answering AI system that gained widespread recognition by defeating human champions on the quiz show Jeopardy! in 2011. Watson showcased the potential of AI systems to process natural language, understand context, and provide accurate answers to complex questions.

6\. Neural Style Transfer: Neural style transfer is a technique that uses deep neural networks to apply the artistic style of one image to another. This research demonstrated AI's ability to recreate various art styles, leading to the development of apps like Prisma.

7\. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs are a class of AI algorithms that generate synthetic data by employing two neural networks - a generator and a discriminator - that compete against each other. GANs have revolutionized the field of image synthesis, enabling the creation of highly realistic and detailed images.

8\. AlphaFold: Developed by DeepMind, AlphaFold is an AI system for protein folding prediction. It won the CASP13 competition in 2018 and CASP14 in 2020, showcasing significant progress in predicting protein structures, which is crucial for understanding diseases and drug discovery.

9\. Self-Driving Cars: Research in self-driving cars, spearheaded by companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Uber, has made significant advancements in AI. These autonomous vehicles use AI algorithms for object detection, decision-making, and navigation, aiming to revolutionize transportation and reduce road accidents.

10\. DALL-E: Developed by OpenAI, DALL-E is an AI model capable of creating original images based on textual descriptions. It can generate highly imaginative and surreal images based on user prompts, showcasing the potential of AI in creative applications.

 

## What are other terms related to artificial intelligence (AI)?

1\. Machine Learning: It refers to a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions autonomously.

2\. Deep Learning: It is a type of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to extract meaningful patterns and solve complex problems.

3\. Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP involves the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, allowing for tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbot interactions.

4\. Computer Vision: It is the field of AI that enables computers to extract information and understand visual data from images or videos. Computer vision enables applications such as image recognition, object detection, and autonomous driving.

5\. Robotics: Robotics combines AI with mechanical engineering to create machines that can perform tasks autonomously or assist humans in various tasks. It involves the development of robots capable of sensing, reasoning, and acting in the physical world.

6\. Expert Systems: These are AI systems that possess specialized knowledge in a particular domain. They use rule-based reasoning and logic to make decisions or provide recommendations, mimicking the expertise of human specialists.

7\. Neural Networks: Neural networks refer to a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. They are used in various AI applications, such as pattern recognition, speech recognition, and predictive modeling.

8\. Reinforcement Learning: This is a learning technique in which an AI agent learns through interactions with its environment. The agent receives rewards or punishments based on its actions, enabling it to learn optimal behaviors over time.

9\. Natural Language Generation (NLG): NLG is a subfield of AI that focuses on generating human-like language from structured data. It enables machines to automatically generate reports, summaries, or narratives in natural language.

10\. Speech Recognition: Speech recognition involves the ability of computers to understand spoken language and convert it into text or other useful forms. This technology is used in applications like voice assistants, voice transcription, and interactive voice response systems.
