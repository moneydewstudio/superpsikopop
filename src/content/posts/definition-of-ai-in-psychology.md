## What is the definition of AI according to Psychologists?

AI is See artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, is a technology that allows computers or machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. It involves creating computer programs and systems that can think, learn, and make decisions on their own, just like humans do.

AI uses various techniques such as machine learning, which allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance as more information is fed into them. These machines can recognize patterns, sort information, and even solve problems with minimal human intervention.

Some common examples of AI that you may come across are voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, which can understand and respond to your voice commands. AI is also commonly used in computer games to create intelligent opponents that can adapt and learn from your actions during the game.

In a nutshell, artificial intelligence enables computers to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks that would typically require us to think, learn, and make decisions. However, it's important to note that AI is still a growing field and has its limitations.
