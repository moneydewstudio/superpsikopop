## What is the definition of backward conditioning according to Psychologists?

backward conditioning is A variant of classical conditioning in which the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) precedes the conditioned stimulus (CS). There is some disagreement over whether backward conditioning is really possible. If it can occur, it is certainly difficult to achieve.

Backward conditioning is a way of learning where something that usually makes you react is shown to you after something that normally doesn't make you react. Some people are not sure if this type of learning is really possible. If it does happen, it is definitely hard to make it happen.
