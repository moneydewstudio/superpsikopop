## What is the definition of acoustic store according to Psychologists?

acoustic store is The part of the working memory system that acts as a short-term storage device for sounds and spoken words.

Imagine your working memory system as a big locker in your brain, with different compartments to store information. One of these compartments is specifically designed to hold sounds and spoken words for a short period of time. It's like a voice recorder that can help you remember what someone just said or help you hold onto a melody or sound you heard.

 

## What are the example case of acoustic store?

There is limited research available specifically on the term "acoustic store." However, there is extensive research on the broader topics related to acoustics and sound storage. One notable area of research is the development of acoustic material or structures for sound absorption, reflection, and diffusion. These materials are commonly used in the construction of concert halls, recording studios, and other spaces where sound quality is crucial.

Here are a few notable research papers related to acoustic materials and sound storage:

1\. "Acoustic metamaterials: From local resonances to broad horizons" by Yu An, Xu Zhang, and Xiaoyong Hu (2020): This paper discusses the concept of acoustic metamaterials, which are engineered materials designed to manipulate sound waves. It explores their potential applications in soundproofing, amplification, and focusing sound energy.

2\. "Sound absorbing structures: Recent developments and future directions" by Niels De Marchi, Jens Forssén, and Sabine Langer (2019): This review paper provides an overview of various sound-absorbing structures, including porous absorbers, microperforated panels, and resonant absorbers. It discusses recent developments and challenges in the field and proposes potential future directions for research.

3\. "Acoustic circuitry: Making sound flow in 2D materials" by Jingqiu Liang, Kejie Fang, and Xiang Zhang (2018): This research paper focuses on using 2D materials (e.g., graphene) to manipulate the flow of sound waves. It discusses the concept of acoustic circuitry, where sound waves can be guided and controlled similar to electronic circuits. The study opens up possibilities for developing compact and efficient sound storage and manipulation devices.

While these papers don't specifically address the term "acoustic store," they provide insights into the broader field of acoustic materials and sound storage.
