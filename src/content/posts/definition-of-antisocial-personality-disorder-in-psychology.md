## What is the definition of antisocial personality disorder according to Psychologists?

antisocial personality disorder is A personality problem in which the individual shows a chronic disregard for social conventions or acceptable behaviour, typically acting in a disruptive or disturbing manner. See also sociopathy.

A personality problem means that a person has some issues with how they behave. In this case, the person doesn't follow the rules or act in a way that other people usually think is good. They might do things that disturb or bother others. This behavior happens a lot and doesn't seem to change. This is somewhat similar to sociopathy, which is another term used for this problem.

This research by Robert D. Hare is highly regarded in the field of psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). It explores the core features of psychopathy and provides insights into the affective and behavioral aspects of the disorder.
