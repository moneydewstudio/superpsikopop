## What is the definition of ambiguous according to Psychologists?

ambiguous is Having more than one possible meaning. An ambiguous stimulus is one that can be interpreted in more than one way (see Figure 2).

Imagine you see something that can be understood or interpreted in different ways. This is called ambiguity. For example, if you look at a picture or an object and it can be seen or understood in more than one way, then it is an ambiguous stimulus.

 

## What are the example case of ambiguous?

Here are two important and notable research studies related to the term "ambiguous": 1. "The Effects of Ambiguity in Language" by Albert Mehrabian (1972): This influential study examined the impact of ambiguous communication on interpersonal relationships. Mehrabian explored how verbal ambiguity (when words have multiple meanings) and non-verbal ambiguity (when gestures or facial expressions can be interpreted differently) affect communication and the perception of the speaker's credibility, trustworthiness, and persuasiveness. The research findings emphasized the significance of clarity and the potential misunderstandings that arise from ambiguity.

2\. "Cognitive Models of Ambiguity Resolution" by Teun A. van Dijk (1977): This study focused on the cognitive processes involved in resolving ambiguities in language comprehension. Van Dijk proposed a model that outlined how readers or listeners use context and prior knowledge to interpret ambiguous statements. The research examined the role of semantic and pragmatic factors in ambiguity resolution and highlighted the dynamic nature of the comprehension process. Understanding ambiguity resolution is vital for fields such as linguistics, psychology, and artificial intelligence, as it sheds light on how humans comprehend and make sense of uncertain information.
