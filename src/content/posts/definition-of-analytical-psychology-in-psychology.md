## What is the definition of analytical psychology according to Psychologists?

analytical psychology is The system of psychopathology and treatment devised by Carl Jung after his split from the Freudian school. It introduces concepts such as the archetype and the collective unconscious.

Carl Jung was a famous psychologist who had different ideas than his teacher, Sigmund Freud. After they went separate ways, Jung created a new way of understanding and treating mental illnesses, which he called the system of psychopathology and treatment.

Jung believed that all people have certain patterns of thoughts and behaviors that are shared across different cultures and times. He called these patterns "archetypes." These archetypes help us understand and explain why people act certain ways or have similar ideas and dreams.

Jung also said that deep within our minds, there is something called the "collective unconscious." This is like a hidden treasure chest that holds all the shared knowledge and experiences of our ancestors. It's like having a big library of information stored in our minds that we may not even be aware of.

So when someone has a mental illness, Jung believed that it might be because they are not in touch with these archetypes or they are not aware of the knowledge in their collective unconscious. By exploring and understanding these things, people can find ways to heal and improve their mental well-being.
