> A specific, rigid pattern of personality characterised by punitive approaches to social sanctions and high levels of prejudice towards out-group members. Adorno showed that the cognitive styles of highly prejudiced right-wing conservatives had two distinctive traits:(i)         rigidity  maintaining a belief system even in the face of direct evidence showing that it is untrue or inefficient; and(ii)        intolerance of ambiguity  a tendency to take sides quickly and to be unable to cope with equivocal positions.Adorno concluded that this was due to defence mechanisms  highly prejudiced individuals had to protect themselves against ambiguities which might challenge their ideas. Moreover, they had often been brought up by cold and highly authoritarian parents, producing a reaction formation whereby the child would displace his or her aggression towards authority figures onto minority groups in society. Adorno measured authoritarianism using the F scale (F for fascism). See also prejudice, social identity theory.

## What is the definition of authoritarian personality according to Psychologists?

authoritarian personality is A specific, rigid pattern of personality characterised by punitive approaches to social sanctions and high levels of prejudice towards out-group members. Adorno showed that the cognitive styles of highly prejudiced right-wing conservatives had two distinctive traits:(i)         rigidity  maintaining a belief system even in the face of direct evidence showing that it is untrue or inefficient; and(ii)        intolerance of ambiguity  a tendency to take sides quickly and to be unable to cope with equivocal positions.Adorno concluded that this was due to defence mechanisms  highly prejudiced individuals had to protect themselves against ambiguities which might challenge their ideas. Moreover, they had often been brought up by cold and highly authoritarian parents, producing a reaction formation whereby the child would displace his or her aggression towards authority figures onto minority groups in society. Adorno measured authoritarianism using the F scale (F for fascism). See also prejudice, social identity theory.

A specific and strict pattern of personality that shows someone being very strict with rules and having strong dislikes towards people who are different from them. Adorno found that people who are highly prejudiced and conservative in their beliefs have two notable traits: (i) they stick to their beliefs even when there is evidence proving them wrong, and (ii) they quickly take sides and struggle with situations that have more than one possible answer. Adorno believed that these traits developed because these individuals needed to protect themselves from things that might challenge their ideas. He also found that these people often had cold and strict parents, which made them take out their anger on groups of people who are different. Adorno used something called the F scale (F for fascism) to measure how authoritarian someone is. This scale helps determine how likely someone is to have these prejudiced beliefs.

 

## What are the example case of authoritarian personality?

1\. Theodor W. Adorno, Else Frenkel-Brunswik, Daniel J. Levinson, and Nevitt Sanford (1950) - The Authoritarian Personality: This classic study examined the characteristics of individuals with an authoritarian personality, linking it to social and political attitudes such as ethnocentrism, prejudice, and support for fascism.

2\. Karen Stenner (2005) - The Authoritarian Dynamic: In this research, Stenner explores the psychological underpinnings of authoritarianism, arguing that individuals with a predisposition for intolerance and authoritarianism can be triggered by social and political threats to become more authoritarian in their attitudes and behavior.

3\. Robert Altemeyer (1981) - Right-Wing Authoritarianism: Developed by Altemeyer, this concept expanded upon earlier work by Adorno and others. It measures individual differences in conformity to traditional social norms, submission to authority, and aggression towards out-group members.

4\. Stanley Milgram (1963) - Obedience to Authority: While not explicitly studying authoritarian personality per se, Milgram's famous experiments explored individuals' willingness to obey authority figures, shedding light on the potential for authoritarian behavior under specific circumstances.

5\. Bob Altemeyer (1996) - The Authoritarian Specter: In this research, Altemeyer provides further validation for his theory of right-wing authoritarianism, examining its implications for party preferences, political attitudes, and intolerance towards minority groups.

6\. John Jost, Jack Glaser, Arie Kruglanski, and Frank Sulloway (2003) - Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition: In this influential paper, the authors argue that individuals' political attitudes, including authoritarianism, are shaped by a complex interplay of psychological motives, such as the need for certainty and order.

7\. Martha C. Nussbaum (2012) - The New Religious Intolerance: Overcoming the Politics of Fear: Nussbaum explores the intersection of religion, politics, and authoritarianism, arguing against the dangers of an exclusionary approach that fosters intolerance.

8\. Karen Stenner and Jonathan Haidt (2008) - Authoritarianism and the Disposition to Fear: Building on Stenner's earlier work, this research delves into the relationship between authoritarianism and individual differences in fear sensitivity and anxiety.

9\. Jonathan Haidt and Jesse Graham (2007) - When Morality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions That Liberals May Not Recognize: Investigating moral differences between liberals and conservatives, this study touches on the role of authoritarian tendencies within conservatism.

10\. Marc Hetherington and Elizabeth Suhay (2011) - Authoritarianism, Threats, and Support for the War on Terror: This research explores how individual variation in authoritarianism affects public support for government policies aimed at combating terrorism, highlighting the relevance of authoritarian personality in contemporary political contexts.
