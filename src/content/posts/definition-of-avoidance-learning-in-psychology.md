## What is the definition of avoidance learning according to Psychologists?

avoidance learning is The training of behaviour through a process of negative reinforcement, such that an aversive stimulus fails to take place if the behaviour is demonstrated. Avoidance learning is extremely resistant to extinction.

Avoidance learning means learning how to avoid something unpleasant by behaving in a certain way. It's like when you do something right and you don't have to face a bad consequence. This type of learning is very strong and hard to forget. It's sort of like when you learn how to ride a bike or tie your shoes, you remember how to do it and avoid getting hurt even after a long time.

 

## What are the example case of avoidance learning?

1\. Garcia, John, and Robert A. Koelling. "Relation of cue to consequence in avoidance learning." Psychonomic Science 4.3 (1966): 123-124. This classic study by Garcia and Koelling examined how rats learned to avoid certain foods by associating them with negative consequences, such as nausea. They found that rats had a natural aversion to certain tastes (e.g., sweet) and were better at avoiding foods associated with nausea if they had a strong taste aversion to begin with.

2\. Mowrer, Orval Hobart. "Two-factor learning theory: Summary and comment." Psychological review 62.2 (1955): 106-107. Mowrer's two-factor theory of avoidance learning proposes that it involves both classical conditioning (learning to associate a neutral stimulus with an aversive event) and operant conditioning (learning to perform a behavior to avoid the aversive event). This theory has been influential in understanding the underlying mechanisms of avoidance learning.

3\. Mineka, Susan, and Richard F. Furedy. "Electrodermal conditioning to sexually stimulated films: Acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement." Journal of Abnormal Psychology 88.6 (1979): 616-627. This study explored avoidance learning in relation to sexual arousal. It found that participants could acquire an avoidance response (measured through electrodermal activity) to certain films by pairing them with aversive stimuli, and this response could be extinguished and reinstated under different conditions.

4\. Solomon, Richard L. "The opponent-process theory of acquired motivation: the costs of pleasure and the benefits of pain." American psychologist 35.8 (1980): 691-712. Solomon's opponent-process theory proposes that avoidance learning occurs due to a motivational imbalance between positive and negative emotional states. According to this theory, avoidance behaviors are motivated by a desire to reduce the negative emotional states that arise as a result of certain stimuli.

5\. Bublatzky, Florian, et al. "A threat-predictive allostatic neural model based on noradrenaline enables anticipation of fear and safety." Nature Communications 7.1 (2016): 1-13. In this more recent research, Bublatzky and colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural mechanisms involved in avoidance learning. They found that the noradrenergic system plays a crucial role in predicting and preparing for threatening events, highlighting the importance of this neurotransmitter in the modulation of avoidance behaviors.
