## What is the definition of availability heuristic according to Psychologists?

availability heuristic is The shortcut in human decision-making in which information that is readily available (e.g. as a result of having been recently discussed) is weighted more heavily than other, equally significant information. In other words, it is the idea that people make decisions using the information which comes most readily to mind.

Sometimes when people need to make a decision, they rely on information that is easy to remember or that they just heard about. This is called the availability bias. It means that people give more importance to information that is readily available and may not consider other important information equally. It's like when you have to decide what to have for lunch and you remember seeing a commercial for a pizza place, so you choose pizza without thinking about other options.

 

## What are the example case of availability heuristic?

1\. Tversky, A., & Kahneman, D. (1973). Availability: A heuristic for judging frequency and probability. Cognitive psychology, 5(2), 207-232. This seminal research paper by Tversky and Kahneman introduced and extensively discussed the availability heuristic. The study explored how people rely on the availability of information in memory to make probability judgments, sometimes leading to systematic biases in decision-making.

2\. Schwarz, N., Bless, H., Strack, F., Klumpp, G., Rittenauer-Schatka, H., & Simons, A. (1991). Ease of retrieval as information: Another look at the availability heuristic. Journal of personality and social psychology, 61(2), 195-202. Schwarz et al. conducted a series of experiments to examine the role of ease of retrieval in activating the availability heuristic. They found that judgments influenced by the availability heuristic can be biased by factors that affect the ease of generating relevant instances from memory.

3\. Slovic, P., Fischhoff, B., & Lichtenstein, S. (1982). Facts and fears: Understanding perceived risk. In Societal risk assessment (pp. 181-216). Springer, Boston, MA. This research examined how the availability heuristic affects people's perceptions of risk. The authors found that people tend to judge risks based on the ease with which instances of the risk can be mentally retrieved, leading to biased risk assessments.

4\. Griffin, D., & Tversky, A. (1992). The weighing of evidence and the determinants of confidence. Cognitive psychology, 24(3), 411-435. Griffin and Tversky investigated how people use the availability heuristic to determine confidence in their judgments. They found that judgments tend to rely on the availability of instances that support the judgment, leading to overconfidence when those instances are easily retrieved.

5\. Fiedler, K., Walther, E., & Nickel, S. (1991). Covariation assessment by human observers: Evidence for selective learning strategies. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 120(3), 323-338. Fiedler and colleagues explored how the availability heuristic interacts with selective learning strategies. The research demonstrated that individuals tend to focus on information that supports their initial assumptions and ignore information that contradicts them, leading to biased judgments based on the availability of confirming instances.

These are just a few notable research studies on the availability heuristic, but there is a wealth of additional research that investigates various aspects of its impact on decision-making, risk perception, and judgment.

 

## What are other terms related to availability heuristic?

1\. Representativeness heuristic: This is a cognitive bias where people make judgments based on how closely an event or situation resembles a prototype or familiar category. It is similar to availability heuristic as both biases rely on mental shortcuts.

2\. Anchoring and adjustment heuristic: This heuristic involves the tendency to rely too heavily on an initial piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions, and then adjusting insufficiently from that anchor. While different from availability heuristic, it can also influence decision-making processes.

3\. Fluency heuristic: This heuristic suggests that people often judge the truthfulness or validity of a statement based on how easily it comes to mind. It shares a similarity with availability heuristic as both involve relying on information that is easily accessible in memory.

4\. Vividness heuristic: This is the tendency to place greater importance on vivid, emotionally striking, or memorable information when making decisions or judgments. It is akin to availability heuristic, as both biases involve the reliance on easily accessible information.

5\. Base rate fallacy: This describes the tendency for individuals to ignore or underestimate relevant statistical information (base rates) when making judgments or decisions. While conceptually different, it can overlap with availability heuristic, as both biases can influence decision-making processes.

6\. Priming effect: This refers to the implicit influence of an initial stimulus on subsequent thoughts and behavior. It is somewhat related to availability heuristic, as both involve the activation or accessibility of specific information in memory.

These terms share commonalities with availability heuristic, either in terms of their cognitive biases or in how they influence decision-making processes.
