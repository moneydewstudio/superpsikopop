## What is the definition of anger management according to Psychologists?

anger management is a form of psychotherapy recently developed in response to increasing concerns about violence including domestic abuse. See also nonviolent resistance.

There is a kind of talking therapy that was made to help people who are violent or hurting others, like in families. This therapy was made because people are worried about how much violence there is in the world. This therapy helps people learn new ways to deal with their feelings and problems without being violent. It's called nonviolent resistance, which means finding peaceful ways to stand up against bad things.
