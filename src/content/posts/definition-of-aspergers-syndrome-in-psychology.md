> A condition characterised by difficulties in non-verbal communication and social interaction, which are generally accompanied by repetitive patterns of behaviour carried to the extent of actually interfering with, or restricting, the persons everyday living. Aspergers syndrome is considered to be a mild form of autistic spectrum disorder, but it is different from most of the others in that the persons use of language and intellectual abilities are unaffected.

## What is the definition of Aspergers syndrome according to Psychologists?

Aspergers syndrome is A condition characterised by difficulties in non-verbal communication and social interaction, which are generally accompanied by repetitive patterns of behaviour carried to the extent of actually interfering with, or restricting, the persons everyday living. Aspergers syndrome is considered to be a mild form of autistic spectrum disorder, but it is different from most of the others in that the persons use of language and intellectual abilities are unaffected.

Asperger's syndrome is a condition where a person has trouble with things like understanding facial expressions and body language, and making friends. They may also do the same things over and over again, which can make it hard for them to do regular activities. Asperger's is a type of autism, but unlike other types, it doesn't affect how they speak or how smart they are.

The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ): Evidence from Asperger Syndrome/High-Functioning Autism, Males and Females, Scientists and Mathematicians. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 31(1), 5-17. This study developed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) as a self-report questionnaire to measure the autistic traits in both clinical and nonclinical populations. They found that individuals with Asperger's syndrome scored significantly higher on the AQ compared to controls, indicating its usefulness as a tool for identifying autistic traits.

2\. Happé, F., Ronald, A., & Plomin, R. (2006). Time to give up on a single explanation for autism. Nature Neuroscience, 9(10), 1218-1220. This research challenges the concept of Asperger's syndrome as a separate disorder from autism and argues for a more dimensional approach to understanding autism. It suggests that there is no clear dividing line between individuals with Asperger's syndrome and those with autism, and instead proposes a continuum of autistic traits.

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 35(3), 331-335. This study examines the diagnostic validity of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) as a screening tool for Asperger's syndrome in adults. They found that the AQ had good sensitivity and specificity, suggesting its utility as a screening measure for identifying individuals who may require further diagnostic evaluation.

4\. Ozonoff, S., Dawson, G., & McPartland, J. (2002). A Parent's Guide to Asperger Syndrome and High-Functioning Autism: How to Meet the Challenges and Help Your Child Thrive. Guilford Press. This research-based book provides practical guidance for parents of children with Asperger's syndrome and high-functioning autism. It covers various aspects of the condition, including diagnosis, interventions, education, and social and emotional support, and synthesizes information from current research and clinical expertise.

5\. Klin, A., Pauls, D., Schultz, R., & Volkmar, F. (2005). Three Diagnostic Approaches to Asperger Syndrome: Implications for Research. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 35(2), 221-234. This study compares three different diagnostic approaches to Asperger's syndrome: DSM-IV criteria, Gillberg's criteria, and SZ criteria. They found that the three approaches yielded different diagnostic rates, highlighting the need for consistent diagnostic criteria to enhance research comparability and clinical decision-making.
