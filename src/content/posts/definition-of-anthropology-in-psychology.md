## What is the definition of anthropology according to Psychologists?

anthropology is The study of different human societies, involving a particular emphasis on social structures and belief systems. An anthropologist is one who undertakes such a study, using either non-participant or participant observational techniques.

Anthropology is a fancy word that means studying how people in different groups live and what they believe. A person who studies this is called an anthropologist. They can either watch from the sidelines or actually be a part of the group they're studying.

 

## What are the example case of anthropology?

1\. Stanford Prison Experiment: Conducted by Philip Zimbardo, this study examined the effects of perceived power on individuals' behavior. It involved randomly assigning participants to the roles of either prisoners or guards in a simulated prison environment. The study highlighted the powerful impact of social roles and situational factors on human behavior.

2\. Milgram Experiment: Conducted by Stanley Milgram, this study aimed to explore the extent to which individuals would obey authority figures, even if it meant causing harm to others. Participants were asked to administer electric shocks to a "learner" whenever they made a mistake. The study revealed the surprising level of obedience and willingness to harm others exhibited by ordinary people when instructed to do so by an authority figure.

3\. Asch Conformity Experiment: Solomon Asch's study focused on social conformity, exploring the impact of group pressure on individual decision-making. Participants were asked to compare the length of lines and provide their answers aloud in the presence of confederates who deliberately provided incorrect answers. The study demonstrated the power of conformity, as a significant number of individuals gave incorrect answers to fit in with the group.

4\. Standford Marshmallow Experiment: Conducted by Walter Mischel, this study investigated delayed gratification and its relationship with future success. Young children were given a choice to eat one marshmallow or wait for a period to receive two marshmallows. The study found that those children who were able to delay gratification demonstrated higher levels of self-control and were more successful later in life.

5\. Harlow's Monkey Experiments: Conducted by Harry Harlow, these experiments studied the importance of maternal attachment in the development of primates. Harlow separated infant monkeys from their mothers and offered them surrogate mothers made of either wire or soft cloth. The study highlighted the critical role of comfort and affection in attachment, as the monkeys showed a strong preference for the soft and nurturing surrogate mothers.

These notable research studies in the field of termanthropology shed light on various aspects of human behavior, including power dynamics, obedience to authority, social conformity, self-control, and the significance of attachment and nurturing relationships.
