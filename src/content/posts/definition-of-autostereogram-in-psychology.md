## What is the definition of autostereogram according to Psychologists?

autostereogram is A complex twodimensional image that appears to be three-dimensional if looked at for a prolonged period. Popularly known as Magic Eye images, they appear at first to be composed entirely of random coloured dots or small shapes but resolve themselves into apparently 3D images to those with relatively balanced binocular vision. See also stereoscope.

A complex picture that looks like it has depth and pops out if you stare at it for a long time. These pictures are called 'Magic Eye' images. At first, it may seem like they are made up of random colored dots or shapes, but if your eyes work well together, the picture will come to life and look like it is three-dimensional. They are similar to a device called a stereoscope.
