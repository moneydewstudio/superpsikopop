## What is the definition of anorexia nervosa according to Psychologists?

anorexia nervosa is A disorder in which the person becomes unable to eat and may starve to death. Anorexia is most common among teenage girls and is often initiated by excessive dieting. Anorexia has been thought of variously as arising from a distorted body image, as a subconscious attempt to return to prepubertal physique and, by implication, social role, and as an expression of rebellion against domination by a mother figure. See also bulimia, eating disorders.

Anorexia is a problem where someone can't eat enough food and might end up really sick or even die. It happens a lot to teenage girls who start by trying to lose weight too much. Some people think anorexia happens because they see their body in a weird way or they want to look like they did before they hit puberty. It can also be a way for them to rebel against their mom or someone who controls them. It is related to other problems like bulimia and other eating disorders.
