> One of a pair of genes. Most organisms have pairs of chromosomes, with matching genes situated on each chromosome. If the two alleles are different in form, one may be a dominant gene over the other (e.g. in eye colour, brown is dominant over blue), or both may contribute to the eventual phenotype (e.g. as in skin colour, where both alleles contribute to the final result). Partial dominance is also possible.

## What is the definition of allele according to Psychologists?

allele is One of a pair of genes. Most organisms have pairs of chromosomes, with matching genes situated on each chromosome. If the two alleles are different in form, one may be a dominant gene over the other (e.g. in eye colour, brown is dominant over blue), or both may contribute to the eventual phenotype (e.g. as in skin colour, where both alleles contribute to the final result). Partial dominance is also possible.

One of a pair of genes means that there are usually two copies of each gene in our body. These genes are located on chromosomes, and each chromosome has a matching pair of genes.

Sometimes, the two copies of a gene can be different from each other. In some cases, one gene can be more powerful than the other and have more influence on how we look or function. For example, in eye color, if one gene says our eyes should be brown and the other says they should be blue, the brown gene will be stronger and our eyes will be brown.

However, in some situations, both genes can work together to influence our characteristics. For instance, in skin color, both genes can contribute to determining the final color of our skin.

Sometimes, the genes may have equal influence, and this is called partial dominance.

 

## What are the example case of allele?

Allocentrism refers to the belief or orientation towards the collective rather than individual goals or interests. While there might not be extensive research explicitly focused on the concept of allocentrism, it is a concept that has been explored within the broader fields of psychology, sociology, and cross-cultural studies. Here are a few notable studies:

1\. Triandis, H. C. (1995). Individualism and collectivism. Westview Press. - This book by Harry C. Triandis is considered a classic in the study of individualism and collectivism, which are closely related to allocentrism. It explores the cultural differences between societies that prioritize the individual (individualism) and those that prioritize the collective (collectivism).

2\. Brewer, M. B., & Chen, Y. R. (2007). Where (who) are collectives in collectivism? Toward conceptual clarification of individualism and collectivism. Psychological Review, 114(1), 133-151. - This article by Marilynn B. Brewer and Ying-yi Hong focuses on the conceptual clarification of individualism and collectivism. It examines the various complexities of these constructs and provides insights into how collectivism can manifest in different ways across cultures.

3\. Chirkov, V. I., Ryan, R. M., Kim, Y., & Kaplan, U. (2003). Differentiating autonomy from individualism and independence: A self-determination theory perspective on internalization of cultural orientations and well-being. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84(1), 97-110. - This study by Valery I. Chirkov and colleagues explores the differentiation between autonomy, individualism, and independence within the context of self-determination theory. It highlights the importance of cultural orientations and their impact on well-being.

4\. Oyserman, D., Coon, H. M., & Kemmelmeier, M. (2002). Rethinking individualism and collectivism: Evaluation of theoretical assumptions and meta-analyses. Psychological Bulletin, 128(1), 3-72. - In this meta-analysis, Daphna Oyserman, Heather M. Coon, and Markus Kemmelmeier critically evaluate the theoretical assumptions of individualism and collectivism. They challenge the existing notions and question the universality of these constructs, providing a thought-provoking analysis of the topic.

While these studies do not specifically address allocentrism, they offer insights into the related constructs of collectivism and individualism, which can be valuable for a better understanding of allocentrism.
