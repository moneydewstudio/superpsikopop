## What is the definition of autonomy according to Psychologists?

autonomy is A state of independence and self-determination in the individual, considered to be the ultimate goal of therapies based on humanistic psychology and existentialism.

Independence means being able to do things on your own and make your own decisions. Self-determination means being able to choose what you want to do and who you want to be. Therapies based on humanistic psychology and existentialism help people become more independent and in control of their own lives.

It's like becoming a strong and confident person who can think for themselves and decide what's best for them.
