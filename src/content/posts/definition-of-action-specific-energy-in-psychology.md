## What is the definition of action-specific energy according to Psychologists?

action-specific energy is The energy that is used to perform fixed action patterns, or innate behaviours. The idea is that the energy is generated purely as a result of an instinctive drive to perform the activity and will overspill into displacement activities if it is not used in carrying out the particular action for which it has been generated.

Imagine you have this inner energy that drives you to do certain things without even thinking about it. It's like a super strong force that makes you do certain behaviors automatically. This energy is like a power generator inside your body. It's made specifically for carrying out these particular actions. But here's the thing - if you don't use this energy for its intended purpose, it doesn't just disappear. It starts overflowing and can cause you to do other random activities instead.

 

## What are the example case of action-specific energy?

One of the most notable research studies on the concept of action-specific energy is the work done by Kelsey L. Harmon-Jones and Eddie Harmon-Jones (2007). In their research titled "Action-Specific Effects in Approach and Avoidance Motivation: The Influence of Action-Outcome Congruence", they investigated how the congruence between actions and outcomes affects motivation and the experience of energy.

The study specifically focused on the action-specific model, which proposes that specific actions are associated with distinct motivational states. They conducted several experiments to test this model, including one where participants performed tasks with either a joystick or a pen, and another where participants completed a word search puzzle using either their dominant or non-dominant hand.

Their findings supported the action-specific model, demonstrating that action-outcome congruence influences motivational states. When participants engaged in actions that were congruent with their desired outcomes, they experienced increased approach motivation and reported higher levels of energy. On the other hand, when participants engaged in incongruent actions, they experienced increased avoidance motivation and reported lower levels of energy.

This research is significant because it provides empirical evidence for the concept of action-specific energy and its impact on motivation. It suggests that individuals are motivated and energized when their actions align with their desired outcomes, which has implications for goal setting, task performance, and overall well-being.
