## What is the definition of archetypes according to Psychologists?

archetypes is Classic, powerful images which, according to Carl Jung, are held in the collective unconscious and recur frequently in folk art and mythology. Examples of Jungian archetypes are the earth mother, the sea as a symbol of rebirth, the omnipotent father, the inaccessible virgin and the knave.

Classic, powerful images are like really important pictures that many people have deep inside their minds without realizing it. These pictures show up a lot in old stories and artwork that people have been sharing for a long time. Carl Jung, a smart person who studied these things, believed that these images are part of what he called the "collective unconscious." It's like a special place where all of our hidden thoughts and feelings come from.

Some examples of these important images, or "archetypes," that Jung talked about are: the earth mother, which is a symbol of a really caring and nurturing person or thing; the sea, which represents starting over or being born again; the all-powerful father, who is like a super strong and important figure; the virgin, who is pure and untouchable; and the knave, who is kind of like a sneaky and mischievous character.

So, when we see or hear about these archetypes in stories, myths, or even in artwork, they can bring up certain feelings or meanings that people have felt for a really long time. It's kind of like these powerful images speak to something deep inside us, even if we may not fully understand it.
