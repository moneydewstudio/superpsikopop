## What is the definition of anaphor according to Psychologists?

anaphor is A pronoun or other word that takes its reference from a previous phrase or sentence.

A "pronoun" is a word that we use instead of repeating a name or a noun. For example, instead of saying "John went to the park. John played soccer," we can say "John went to the park. He played soccer." In this case, "he" is a pronoun that refers back to John. So, when we use a pronoun, it saves us from having to keep repeating the same name or noun over and over again.

 

## What are the example case of anaphor?

One of the most important and notable research papers regarding the term "anaphor" is "Centering: A Framework for Modeling the Local Coherence of Discourse" by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983).

In this influential paper, the authors present the "centering theory" which provides a framework for understanding how pronouns, noun phrases, and other referring expressions relate to each other in discourse. The theory focuses on the notion of "center" which is the most salient entity in a discourse segment and explains the transition patterns that occur when a new center is introduced.

The centering theory helps in predicting how different anaphoric expressions within a sentence or across sentences are resolved, and how they influence the overall coherence of the discourse. This work has influenced numerous subsequent studies on anaphora resolution, discourse understanding, and natural language processing.

Overall, the paper by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983) has had a significant impact on our understanding of anaphora and has paved the way for further research in this field.
