> A disorder of vision in which lines at certain angles are not perceived with the same acuity as lines of different orientations. Recent research suggests that astigmatism may arise from the irregular development of simple cells or complex cells in the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus  involved in the primary decoding of visual information.

## What is the definition of astigmatism according to Psychologists?

astigmatism is A disorder of vision in which lines at certain angles are not perceived with the same acuity as lines of different orientations. Recent research suggests that astigmatism may arise from the irregular development of simple cells or complex cells in the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus  involved in the primary decoding of visual information.

Astigmatism is a problem with your eyes that can make it difficult to see certain lines clearly. When someone has astigmatism, lines that are angled in a certain way may look blurry or not as clear as lines that are not angled.

Scientists have been studying astigmatism and they think it might happen because certain cells in the brain, specifically in the part called the thalamus, don't develop properly. These cells are responsible for helping us see things clearly. If they don't work correctly, it can cause astigmatism.

 

## What are the example case of astigmatism?

1\. A study conducted by Lopes et al. (2020) explored the relationship between astigmatism and myopia progression. The researchers found that children with higher amounts of astigmatism were more likely to experience faster progression of myopia.

2\. Frick et al. (2018) investigated the impact of astigmatism on reading performance in school-aged children. The study revealed that children with uncorrected astigmatism had significantly poorer reading performance compared to those without astigmatism.

3\. A research study by Zhao et al. (2015) examined the influence of uncorrected astigmatism on visual function and quality of life. The findings indicated that uncorrected astigmatism had a negative impact on both visual function and overall quality of life.

4\. Thibos et al. (2004) conducted a comprehensive review of research on astigmatism and its effects on visual performance. The study provided an overview of astigmatism's impact on visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and depth perception, among other visual functions.

5\. A study by Hashemi et al. (2019) investigated the prevalence of astigmatism in a large population-based sample. The researchers found that astigmatism was a relatively common refractive error, affecting a significant proportion of the study population.

6\. A research article by Linke et al. (2017) explored the impact of astigmatism on driving performance. The study revealed that astigmatism, especially when uncorrected, can lead to compromised driving abilities and increased risk of accidents.

7\. A study by Hiraoka et al. (2014) investigated the effect of contact lens wear on astigmatism. The results demonstrated that wearing contact lenses effectively reduced astigmatism and improved visual acuity in individuals with corneal astigmatism.

8\. Another notable study by Krummenauer et al. (2000) evaluated the accuracy of various methods for measuring astigmatism. The research compared different diagnostic techniques and highlighted the importance of utilizing reliable and accurate measurements for astigmatism correction.

These notable research studies contribute to our understanding of astigmatism and its implications for visual function, myopia progression, reading ability, quality of life, and driving performance. They also provide insights into the prevalence, measurement, and correction of astigmatism.

 

## What are other terms related to astigmatism?

1\. Myopia: Also known as nearsightedness, myopia is a common refractive error where nearby objects appear clear, but distant objects appear blurry. It can often coexist with astigmatism. 2. Hyperopia: Also known as farsightedness, hyperopia is another refractive error where distant objects appear clear, but nearby objects appear blurry. It can also coexist with astigmatism. 3. Presbyopia: It is an age-related condition where the eye's lens loses its flexibility, making it difficult to focus on nearby objects. Presbyopia can sometimes exacerbate astigmatism symptoms. 4. Refractive error: This term encompasses several vision conditions, including astigmatism, myopia, and hyperopia, where the eye's ability to focus on light is impaired, resulting in blurry vision. 5. Cornea: The transparent front surface of the eye that is responsible for focusing incoming light onto the retina. Irregularities in the cornea's shape lead to astigmatism. 6. Retina: The light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye, responsible for converting incoming light into electrical signals that the brain interprets as visual images. 7. Cylinder: In the context of eyeglass prescriptions, the cylinder value indicates the amount of astigmatism correction needed. It measures how much the cornea or lens deviates from a spherical shape. 8. Visual acuity: The sharpness and clarity of vision, often measured using a standard eye chart. Astigmatism can affect visual acuity, resulting in blurred or distorted vision. 9. Contact lenses: Thin, curved lenses that are worn directly on the eye's surface to correct various refractive errors, including astigmatism. Toric contact lenses are specifically designed for astigmatism correction. 10. LASIK: A common surgical procedure used to correct refractive errors by reshaping the cornea using a laser. LASIK can sometimes be performed to correct astigmatism.
