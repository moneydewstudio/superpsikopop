## What is the definition of afferent dysgraphia according to Psychologists?

afferent dysgraphia is Additions or omissions of strokes or parts of writing that happen as a result of failing to utilise visual and/or kinaesthetic feedback effectively. See dysgraphia.

Sometimes, when someone has trouble using their eyes and body to write, they may make mistakes like adding or leaving out strokes or parts of their writing. This can happen because they are not using their eyes and body in a helpful way. This issue is called dysgraphia.

 

## What are the example case of afferent dysgraphia?

One notable research study regarding the term "afferent dysgraphia" is "Dissociation of processes in visual letter and word recognition: Evidence from a case of pure alexia" published in Cognitive Neuropsychology by Coltheart et al. in 1983.

In this study, the researchers presented a detailed case report of a patient with a unique pattern of reading and writing impairment, specifically showing dissociation between visual letter and word recognition. The patient demonstrated normal visual acuity and object recognition, but he was unable to recognize individual letters or words, leading to severe reading and writing difficulties.

The term "afferent dysgraphia" was introduced to describe this specific impairment in letter recognition and its effect on writing abilities. The study highlighted the fundamental role of afferent (incoming) visual processing deficits in dysgraphia. It helped to deepen the understanding of different types of dysgraphia and the specific impairments associated with each type.

This research study was crucial in broadening our knowledge of afferent dysgraphia and its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. The findings from this study have since been widely cited and discussed in the field, contributing to advancements in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of individuals with dysgraphia.
