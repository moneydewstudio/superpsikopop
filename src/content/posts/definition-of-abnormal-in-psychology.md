## What is the definition of abnormal according to Psychologists?

abnormal is A term applied to behaviour or people who have been classed as not normal. It is a potentially controversial label because of problems in defining normality. Abnormality can be defined in several different ways:

Abnormality is a word we use to describe when someone or their behavior is seen as different from what most people consider to be normal. But here's the tricky thing: normality is not always easy to define because it can vary from person to person and culture to culture. So, what might be normal for one person may be abnormal for another.

There are a few different ways we can try to explain abnormality. One way is by looking at statistics. If most people in a group behave or think a certain way, anything that differs a lot from that might be considered abnormal.

Another way is by looking at whether the behavior or thought patterns cause distress or harm to the person or others around them. For example, if someone's behavior is really upsetting to them or is causing problems in their daily life, it might be seen as abnormal.

Lastly, we can also look at what society considers acceptable and unacceptable. Sometimes, certain behaviors or thoughts that go against the norms or rules of a society are labeled as abnormal.

It's important to note that using the word abnormal can sometimes be controversial because it can make people feel judged or stigmatized. So, it's always best to be understanding and respectful towards others, even if they might seem different from what we consider normal.

 

## What are the example case of abnormal?

Here are some famous and notable research studies related to the term "abnormal":

1\. Rosenhan Experiment (1973): This study challenged the validity of psychiatric diagnoses. Researchers, including David Rosenhan, presented themselves as "pseudopatients" to mental health facilities and were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, despite being mentally healthy.

2\. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM): This widely used manual classifies and defines various mental disorders, including abnormal behaviors. The DSM-5, the latest edition, was published in 2013.

3\. The Stanford Prison Experiment (1971): Philip Zimbardo conducted this famous study to examine the psychological effects of perceived power and abuse in a simulated prison environment. The experiment revealed how quickly situational factors can lead to abnormal and aggressive behavior.

4\. The Milgram Experiment (1961): Stanley Milgram carried out this study to investigate obedience to authority figures. Participants were instructed to administer electric shocks to another person, demonstrating the potential for individuals to engage in morally and socially abnormal behavior.

5\. The Minnesota Twin Study (1979): This long-term research project examined the relative effects of genetics and environment on the development of various psychological disorders, including abnormal behaviors. The study highlighted the importance of both genetic and environmental factors in the manifestation of abnormal behavior.

6\. The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study (1998): Conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Kaiser Permanente, this study explored the relationship between childhood trauma and later mental health issues. It demonstrated the long-lasting impact of adverse childhood experiences on the development of abnormal behaviors and mental disorders.

These studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of abnormal behavior, mental disorders, and the factors that influence them.
