## What is the definition of alexia according to Psychologists?

alexia is A condition in which written words cannot be recognised. It may be complete or partial and is also sometimes called word blindness. It is not a result of poor vision, nor is it caused by failing to understand words, since they can still be understood when spoken. See also pure alexia.

Dyslexia is when a person has trouble recognizing written words. This can happen a little bit or a lot, but it's not because of bad eyesight or not understanding the words themselves. When someone with dyslexia hears the words spoken, they understand them just fine. This condition is sometimes called word blindness and it's different from having trouble with reading due to other issues.
