## What is the definition of autohypnosis according to Psychologists?

autohypnosis is Hypnosis that has been self-induced. Many forms of hypnotherapy concentrate on building up the individuals own skills in autohypnosis so that they can develop strategies of coping behaviour for dealing with stressful events.

Hypnosis is when someone goes into a deep state of relaxation and focus, kind of like daydreaming. When a person is able to do this by themselves, it's called self-induced hypnosis, or autohypnosis.

Some people use hypnosis as a way to help them deal with stressful things that happen in their lives. They learn techniques to make themselves feel better and handle these difficult events. It's like having special tools to help them stay calm and cope with problems.

Think of it as if they have a toolbox full of strategies to help them when they need it most. This way, they can face tough situations with confidence and find ways to manage their stress.
