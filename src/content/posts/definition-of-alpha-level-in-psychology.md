## What is the definition of alpha level according to Psychologists?

alpha level is Also known as the alpha criterion, this is the maximum probability of making a Type I error, as a result of the statistical analysis of a set of data. In student research, the alpha level is usually set at p<.05, but it can be made more stringent by choosing a different level of statistical significance.

Imagine you are doing a research project and analyzing a bunch of data. One thing you need to be careful about is making a mistake in your analysis. Specifically, you want to avoid what's called a Type I error, which means falsely concluding something is true when it's actually not.

To help prevent this mistake, researchers use something called the alpha level, also known as the 'alpha criterion'. It's like a limit they set for themselves. In most cases, they choose an alpha level of p<.05, which means they're willing to accept a maximum 5% chance of making a Type I error. In simpler terms, they're saying they want to be pretty sure before they conclude something is true based on their data.

However, researchers can also make their alpha level even stricter by choosing a smaller value. For example, they could say p<.01, which means they only want to accept a maximum 1% chance of making a Type I error. This way, they become even more cautious and require stronger evidence before drawing conclusions.

Overall, the alpha level is just a way for researchers to set a threshold for how much error they are willing to tolerate in their analysis. It helps them make sure they are being careful and making accurate conclusions based on the data they have gathered.
