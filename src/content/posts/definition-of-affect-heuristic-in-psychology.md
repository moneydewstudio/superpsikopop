## What is the definition of affect heuristic according to Psychologists?

affect heuristic is The use of emotional judgements to influence decision-making.

Using emotions to affect the choices we make.

 

## What are the example case of affect heuristic?

One influential and notable research study relating to the affect heuristic is the work conducted by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. In their study published in 1982, titled "The Psychology of Preferences," they introduced the concept of the affect heuristic and explored its implications.

The affect heuristic is a mental shortcut that individuals use to make judgments and decisions based on their emotional responses or feelings towards a particular stimulus. Kahneman and Tversky demonstrated that people tend to rely on their emotional reactions or gut feelings when making assessments or decisions, rather than engaging in a more rational and deliberate evaluation of the available information.

In their study, Kahneman and Tversky examined how the affect heuristic influences people's preferences for different types of gambles involving monetary gains and losses. They found that individuals were more likely to choose risky options that offered a potential gain if the options evoked positive emotions, even if the expected value of the risky option was lower than a safer alternative. Conversely, people tended to avoid risky options that provoked negative emotions, even if the expected value of the risky option was higher than a safer alternative.

This research highlighted the powerful impact of emotions on decision-making processes and revealed the potential biases introduced by the affect heuristic. The findings have important implications for various domains, such as economics, finance, marketing, and public policy, as they provide insights into how emotional responses can influence individuals' choices and judgments, often leading to suboptimal decisions.

Overall, Kahneman and Tversky's groundbreaking work on the affect heuristic has contributed significantly to our understanding of human decision-making and the influence of emotions in shaping preferences and judgments.
