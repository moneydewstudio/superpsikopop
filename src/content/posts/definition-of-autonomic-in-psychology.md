## What is the definition of autonomic according to Psychologists?

autonomic is Resulting from the activation of the autonomic nervous system.

When something happens that makes your body react automatically, it's because of a part of your nervous system called the autonomic nervous system. It controls things in your body like your heart beating, your breathing, and even how you feel in certain situations. So, when the autonomic nervous system gets activated, it means that your body is responding to something without you having to think about it.
