> A procedure in operant conditioning in which a neutral stimulus is associated with a reinforcer, for example, by making a disc change colour whenever a food pellet is delivered, with the result that the pigeons behaviour is shaped so that eventually it will peck the disc despite never having been directly reinforced for doing so. See also behaviour shaping.

## What is the definition of autoshaping according to Psychologists?

autoshaping is A procedure in operant conditioning in which a neutral stimulus is associated with a reinforcer, for example, by making a disc change colour whenever a food pellet is delivered, with the result that the pigeons behaviour is shaped so that eventually it will peck the disc despite never having been directly reinforced for doing so. See also behaviour shaping.

Operant conditioning is a way of training animals, like pigeons, to do certain things. One way this is done is by using a special signal that doesn't mean anything at first. But, when the animal gets something it likes, like food, at the same time as the signal, it starts to connect the two. Eventually, the animal learns that when it sees the signal, it's going to get food, so it starts doing a certain action, like pecking a disc, to get the food, even if it hasn't gotten food directly for doing that action before. This is called behavior shaping and it helps the animal learn new behaviors.
