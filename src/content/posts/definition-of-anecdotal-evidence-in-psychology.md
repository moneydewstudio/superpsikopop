## What is the definition of anecdotal evidence according to Psychologists?

anecdotal evidence is Information quoted in support of an idea or theory that has been obtained purely from everyday experience or accounts, rather than from some form of systematic or controlled study.

When people want to prove their ideas or theories, they sometimes share information they learned from their own experiences or what they heard from others. This information is not from organized or scientific studies, but rather from regular everyday situations. It's like saying something is true because a few people said so, rather than showing proof from well-organized and carefully planned research.

## What are other terms related to anecdotal evidence?

Definition: Anecdotal evidence refers to informal observations or personal experiences that are not scientifically validated and therefore, cannot be considered as reliable or representative of a larger population.

cognitive dissonance

Definition: Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort or tension that arises when there is a discrepancy between a person's beliefs, attitudes, or values, and their behavior or other conflicting information. It often leads to psychological discomfort and motivates individuals to reduce this dissonance by altering their beliefs or behaviors.

confirmation bias

Definition: Confirmation bias is the tendency of individuals to selectively seek, interpret, and remember information that confirms or supports their pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses, while ignoring or discounting contradictory evidence. It can lead to biased judgments and decision-making, as well as reinforce existing cognitive or belief systems.

Milgram experiment

Definition: The Milgram experiment is a famous psychological study conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s to examine people's obedience to authority. It involved participants being instructed to administer increasingly intense electric shocks to a learner (who was actually an actor) as punishment for incorrect answers in a memory task, with the purpose of investigating the extent to which individuals would comply with authority figures even when it caused harm to others.

operant conditioning

Definition: Operant conditioning is a learning process in psychology where behavior is modified through the use of rewards or punishments. It involves associating specific behaviors with specific consequences, which can either increase the likelihood of the behavior recurring (reinforcement) or decrease it (punishment). It is widely used in behavior modification techniques and animal training.
