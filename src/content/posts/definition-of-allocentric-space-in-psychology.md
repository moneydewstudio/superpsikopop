## What is the definition of allocentric space according to Psychologists?

allocentric space is A spatial map in which the items have been coded relative to one another. See also egocentric space.

A spatial map is like a picture or diagram that shows how things are arranged in a certain area. Imagine it as a bird's-eye view of a room or a neighborhood. In this type of map, the location of items is shown based on their relationship to one another. For example, it might show that a chair is next to a table, or that a house is across the street from a park.

When we talk about coding items on a spatial map, it means that each item is represented in a certain way to show its position or relationship with other items. This coding could be done using symbols, colors, or other methods to make it easier to understand the map. It helps us understand how things are connected or organized in a particular space.

"Egocentric space" is another term related to spatial maps. It refers to understanding a space from one's own perspective or point of view. It's like imagining how things are arranged around us as if we are at the center of it. This is important because our perception of a space can be influenced by how we see it from our own position.
