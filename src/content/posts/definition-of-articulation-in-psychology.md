## What is the definition of articulation according to Psychologists?

articulation is (i) Clear verbal expression. (ii) Free movement through the action of a joint, sometimes extended to mean the assembly of joints and levers that make such movement possible (e.g. in robotics).

(i) Clear verbal expression means using words and sentences that are easy to understand and get your point across. It's like being able to speak or write in a way that everyone can easily understand what you're saying.

(ii) Free movement through the action of a joint means being able to move your body parts like your arms or legs without any problems. A joint is like a place where two bones connect, and it allows you to bend your body parts. Sometimes, people use this phrase in robotics too, which means putting together different parts that can move freely and work together to make something move.

## What are other terms related to articulation?

1\. Phonetics: The study of the physical sounds of human speech, including the articulation, acoustics, and auditory perception of speech sounds. 2. Articulatory phonetics: The branch of phonetics that focuses on the physical production of speech sounds, including the movements and positions of the articulatory organs (e.g., tongue, lips, teeth). 3. Speech sound: A unit of sound that is produced using specific articulatory configurations and is used to form words and convey meaning. 4. Articulatory organs: The various parts of the human body (e.g., tongue, lips, teeth, vocal cords) that are involved in the production of speech sounds. 5. Articulation disorder: A speech disorder that involves difficulties with the physical movements and coordination of the articulatory organs, resulting in unclear or distorted speech. 6. Vowel: A speech sound produced by a relatively open vocal tract, with no obstructed airflow and a characteristic sound quality. 7. Consonant: A speech sound produced by either partially or completely obstructing the airflow through the vocal tract, resulting in various sound qualities. 8. Phonology: The study of the patterns and structures of speech sounds in a particular language or languages. 9. Speech production: The process of transforming linguistic information into sounds using the articulatory organs and other speech production mechanisms. 10. Phoneme: The smallest distinctive unit of sound in a language that can change the meaning of a word when swapped with another phoneme.
