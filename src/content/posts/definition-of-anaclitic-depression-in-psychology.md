When babies are separated from their moms for a long time when they are between 6 and 18 months old, they may feel very sad and upset. This is called "hospitalism".

Anaclitic depression refers to a type of depression that is characterized by feelings of intense sadness, emptiness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in life. It is often caused by the loss or separation from a primary caregiver or attachment figure, leading to feelings of abandonment and helplessness.

1\. Attachment figure: An attachment figure refers to the primary caregiver or person with whom an individual has formed a strong emotional bond. This could be a parent, guardian, or any person who provides a sense of security and emotional support.

2\. Separation anxiety: Separation anxiety is a normal psychological response that occurs when a person is separated or anticipates being separated from their attachment figure. It is often observed in young children but can also occur in adults, particularly in cases of anaclitic depression.

3\. Abandonment: Abandonment refers to the feeling of being deserted or left behind by someone who was previously present in one's life. In the context of anaclitic depression, the loss or separation from an attachment figure can trigger feelings of abandonment.

4\. Helplessness: Helplessness refers to a sense of powerlessness or inability to control one's circumstances or emotions. In anaclitic depression, the loss of a primary caregiver can result in feelings of helplessness, as the individual may struggle to cope with the absence of emotional support and stability.

5\. Emotional deprivation: Emotional deprivation refers to the lack of emotional nurturing or support in one's life. In cases of anaclitic depression, emotional deprivation occurs when a person is separated from their attachment figure or experiences a disruption in the emotional bond, leading to feelings of emptiness and sadness.
