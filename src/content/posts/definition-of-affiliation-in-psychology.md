Another significant study on affiliation is Harry Harlow's experiments with rhesus monkeys. Conducted in the 1950s and 1960s, Harlow's research demonstrated the importance of social attachment and contact comfort.

This study highlighted the significance of emotional bonding and affiliation in establishing secure relationships.
