## What is the definition of balanced scale according to Psychologists?

balanced scale is A test or questionnaire in which sources of bias in the items are counterbalanced. For example, half of the items should be true and half false, so that any preference to answer yes does not distort the outcome. See also questionnaire.

A bias-balanced test or questionnaire is one where we try to make sure that there's no unfair favoring of one answer over another. It's like making sure the questions are fair for everyone taking the test.

One way to do this is by having an equal number of true and false questions. This is important because if we had more questions that are true or false, it might make people want to answer in a specific way and that could affect the results of the test.

So, by having an equal number of true and false questions, we make sure people can answer honestly without feeling like they have to lean towards one side. This helps us get accurate information from the test and understand things better.
