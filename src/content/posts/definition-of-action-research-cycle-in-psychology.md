## What is the definition of action research cycle according to Psychologists?

action research cycle is Action research is generally perceived as a cyclical activity, proceeding from an initial diagnostic or evaluation stage to the development of a change strategy, to an action and implementation stage, then back to another evaluative stage, and so on through the cycle (Figure 1). See also field theory.

Action research is like a continuous loop of steps. First, you observe and figure out what needs to be changed or improved. Then, you come up with a plan to make that change happen. Next, you actually do the thing you planned and put it into action. After that, you evaluate how well it worked and if any adjustments need to be made. Then, you go back to the beginning and start again with new observations and ideas. This cycle keeps repeating as you try to make things better.

 

## What are the example case of action research cycle?

One of the most important and notable research studies regarding the term "action research cycle" is the work of Kurt Lewin. Considered the pioneer of action research, Lewin introduced the concept of a feedback loop, which forms the basis of the action research cycle.

Lewin's research emphasized the need for a continuous cycle of planning, action, observation, and reflection to foster positive change in organizations or communities. He highlighted that this iterative process allows for learning and adaptation throughout the research project.

Another significant contribution to the understanding of the action research cycle comes from Stephen Kemmis and his colleagues. They developed a framework called the "Spiral of Action Research," which expanded upon Lewin's feedback loop. Their model added stages such as problem identification, data collection and analysis, and planning for new actions.

In recent years, Jean McNiff's research has been influential in shaping our understanding of the action research cycle. McNiff emphasizes the importance of practitioner knowledge and self-reflection in the research process. Her work suggests that action researchers should engage in critical self-reflection to continually improve their practice.

Overall, these notable studies and researchers have contributed to establishing the action research cycle as a powerful methodology for driving change and promoting cross-disciplinary collaboration.
