## What is the definition of alpha according to Psychologists?

alpha is The first letter of the Greek alphabet, often used to indicate primacy or importance (e.g. the dominant males in a baboon troop are sometimes referred to as alpha males).

The first letter of the Greek alphabet is called "alpha." It is often used to show that something or someone is in a very important or powerful position. For example, in a group of baboons, the strongest and most dominant males are called "alpha males." This means they are the leaders and have a lot of influence over the rest of the group. So, when something or someone is referred to as "alpha," it means they are at the top or are considered very important and influential.
