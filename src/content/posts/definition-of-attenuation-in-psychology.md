## What is the definition of attenuation according to Psychologists?

attenuation is (i) The shortening or limiting of an object or event.(ii)       In cognitive theory, a term used by Triesman to refer to the weakening of a signal being processed, as an essential part of a model of selective attention. See filter models.

(i) Shortening or limiting means making something smaller or reducing its size or scope. For example, if you have a long story and you summarize it into just a few sentences, you are shortening or limiting the story.

(ii) In cognitive theory, "weakening of a signal" means making a message or information less strong or clear. It's like making the sound of someone speaking softer or muffled, so it's harder to understand. This happens when our brain focuses on specific things and ignores or filters out other information. It's like when you're listening to your teacher in a noisy classroom, and you can only hear what your teacher is saying because you're trying to pay attention to them.

 

## What are the example case of attenuation?

1\. "Attenuation of Sound Waves in the Atmosphere" by Lord Rayleigh: This research, conducted in the late 19th century, examined the phenomenon of sound attenuation in the Earth's atmosphere. It provided insights into the factors affecting the reduction in sound intensity over distance, including air temperature, humidity, and sound frequency.

2\. "Signal Attenuation in Optical Fiber Communication Systems" by C. Lin and G. P. Agrawal: This research focused on the attenuation of light signals in fiber optic communication systems. It explored various factors contributing to signal loss, such as scattering, absorption, and imperfections in the optical fiber, and proposed strategies to mitigate attenuation effects.

3\. "Attenuation of Radio Waves in Urban Environments" by K. Araki et al.: This study investigated the attenuation of radio waves in densely populated urban areas. It analyzed the impact of various urban structures, such as buildings, on signal propagation, and proposed models to estimate attenuation in different urban scenarios.

4\. "Attenuation of Gamma Rays in Materials" by J. Etard and F. Joliot: This research explored the attenuation properties of various materials against gamma rays. It provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of gamma ray absorption, scattering, and penetration in different substances, which is crucial for applications in nuclear physics, radiation therapy, and radiation protection.

5\. "Attenuation of Pathogens in Water Treatment Processes" by D.K. Jensen et al.: This study focused on the attenuation of pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses) during water treatment processes. It examined the effectiveness of different treatment methods, such as disinfection, filtration, and UV irradiation, in reducing pathogenic contaminants in drinking water, ensuring public health and safety.
