> That part of the cerebral cortex which is involved in the decoding of visual symbols. The angular gyrus receives input from the visual cortex and appears to process that information into a form equivalent to information which has been processed by the auditory cortex. The angular gyrus then passes messages on to the area known as Wernickes area, where it is processed for comprehension. Accordingly, the angular gyrus plays an important role in the process of reading, and it is thought that damage to this area is the root cause of certain dyslexias. See also language areas.

## What is the definition of angular gyrus according to Psychologists?

angular gyrus is That part of the cerebral cortex which is involved in the decoding of visual symbols. The angular gyrus receives input from the visual cortex and appears to process that information into a form equivalent to information which has been processed by the auditory cortex. The angular gyrus then passes messages on to the area known as Wernickes area, where it is processed for comprehension. Accordingly, the angular gyrus plays an important role in the process of reading, and it is thought that damage to this area is the root cause of certain dyslexias. See also language areas.

The part of your brain called the angular gyrus helps you understand and make sense of things that you see. It takes information from your eyes and processes it so that it's like the information you would hear if someone was speaking. Then, it sends messages to another part of your brain called Wernicke's area, where that information is understood. The angular gyrus is really important for reading, and if it gets damaged, it can cause some difficulties with reading called dyslexia.

## What are other terms related to angular gyrus?

1\. Angular gyrus function: The angular gyrus is a part of the brain that is involved in various cognitive processes, including language, reading, spatial awareness, and numerical comprehension.

2\. Spatial awareness: Spatial awareness refers to the ability to perceive and understand spatial relationships between objects, oneself, and the environment.

3\. Language processing: Language processing is the cognitive ability to understand, produce, and manipulate linguistic information. The angular gyrus plays a crucial role in language processing, particularly in reading comprehension.

4\. Reading comprehension: Reading comprehension is the ability to understand and interpret written text. The angular gyrus is believed to play a significant role in integrating visual information from text with semantic knowledge, allowing for effective comprehension.

5\. Numerical processing: Numerical processing refers to the cognitive ability to understand and manipulate numerical information. The angular gyrus is involved in numerical comprehension and arithmetic calculations.

6\. Multisensory integration: Multisensory integration is the process by which the brain combines information received from different sensory modalities (such as vision, hearing, touch) to form a unified perception of the world. The angular gyrus aids in integrating sensory inputs and contributing to a coherent perception.

7\. Semantic knowledge: Semantic knowledge refers to the understanding of meaning and concepts associated with words, objects, or events. The angular gyrus plays a role in connecting visual and auditory inputs to associated semantic information.

8\. Visual attention: Visual attention refers to the ability to selectively focus on relevant visual stimuli while filtering out distractions. The angular gyrus is involved in directing attention to specific visual information.

9\. Memory retrieval: Memory retrieval is the process of recalling stored information from long-term memory. The angular gyrus has been associated with memory retrieval, particularly in the context of semantic memory.

10\. Dyslexia: Dyslexia is a learning disorder characterized by difficulties in reading, spelling, and writing. The angular gyrus has been implicated in dyslexia, as individuals with dyslexia often exhibit abnormalities or reduced activation in this brain region.
