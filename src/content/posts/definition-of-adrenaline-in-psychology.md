> A hormone and neurotransmitter produced by the adrenal glands which is particularly associated with emotional states. Adrenaline is involved in states of arousal, initiated by the action of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. It is released as a hormone by the adrenal gland and serves to maintain an activated state of the body such that a higher level of energy is produced by the autonomic functions. It also acts within the brain as a neurotransmitter, where it again is involved in emotional states.

## What is the definition of adrenaline according to Psychologists?

adrenaline is A hormone and neurotransmitter produced by the adrenal glands which is particularly associated with emotional states. Adrenaline is involved in states of arousal, initiated by the action of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. It is released as a hormone by the adrenal gland and serves to maintain an activated state of the body such that a higher level of energy is produced by the autonomic functions. It also acts within the brain as a neurotransmitter, where it again is involved in emotional states.

Adrenaline is a chemical made by special glands in our body called adrenal glands. It works as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter. Adrenaline is mostly known for its role in making us feel excited or scared. It is released when our body needs to be alert and ready for action.

When something exciting or scary happens, like a roller coaster ride or a close call with a car, adrenaline gets released into our bloodstream as a hormone. This hormone makes our body more active, giving us a burst of energy. It makes our heart beat faster, our breathing quicker, and our muscles ready for action. This is why we might feel a rush or a boost of energy during these moments.

Adrenaline also acts as a neurotransmitter in our brain. Neurotransmitters are like messengers that help our brain cells communicate. In the brain, adrenaline is involved in our emotional state. It can make us feel more alert, focused, and even a bit jittery. Think of it like a switch that gets turned on when we are excited or scared, making us feel more alive and ready to face challenges.

Overall, adrenaline is a powerful chemical that helps our body and brain respond to exciting or scary situations. It gives us a burst of energy and affects our emotions. So the next time you feel your heart racing or your body getting pumped up, know that it's adrenaline doing its job to help you cope with whatever is happening.

 

## What are the example case of adrenaline?

One of the most important and notable research studies related to adrenaline is the work conducted by Dr. Walter Bradford Cannon in the early 20th century. He coined the term "fight or flight response" and provided significant insights into how adrenaline (epinephrine) influences the body's physiological and psychological reactions to stress or danger.

Cannon's research, particularly his book "The Wisdom of the Body" published in 1932, highlighted the crucial role of adrenaline in preparing the body for action in response to perceived threats. He demonstrated that adrenaline is released by the adrenal glands during stressful situations, triggering numerous physiological changes.

Cannon's findings and concept of the "fight or flight response" revolutionized the understanding of stress and laid the foundation for subsequent research in the field. His work shed light on the intricate relationship between the brain, autonomic nervous system, and adrenal glands, underscoring the body's complex physiological and psychological responses to stress.

Today, Cannon's research continues to influence various fields of study, including psychology, neuroscience, and endocrinology, providing crucial insights into the impact of adrenaline on human behavior, stress management, and overall well-being.
