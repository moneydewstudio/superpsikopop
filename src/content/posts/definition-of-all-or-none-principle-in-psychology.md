> The principle that a neurone either fires or it does not, with no variation in the strength of the electrical impulse. It was originally thought that all nerve cells operate according to the all-or-none principle  implying a necessity for digital processing models of brain functioning, and fostering some computer simulation approaches to understanding cognition. However, more recent evidence suggests that allor-none firing is uncommon within the brain itself, and that cortical neurones use variable coding.

## What is the definition of all-or-none principle according to Psychologists?

all-or-none principle is The principle that a neurone either fires or it does not, with no variation in the strength of the electrical impulse. It was originally thought that all nerve cells operate according to the all-or-none principle  implying a necessity for digital processing models of brain functioning, and fostering some computer simulation approaches to understanding cognition. However, more recent evidence suggests that allor-none firing is uncommon within the brain itself, and that cortical neurones use variable coding.

The idea here is that when a neuron, which is a type of cell in our brain, sends an electrical signal, it either sends a strong signal or no signal at all. At first, scientists believed that all neurons in the brain work this way, like an on-off switch. This led them to think that the brain works like a computer, with digital signals. They even used computer simulations to try and understand how our brain functions.

However, newer evidence shows that this "all-or-none" firing is not very common in our brain. It turns out that neurons in the outer layer of our brain, called the cortex, use a different way of sending signals. Instead of just strong or no signals, they can send signals of different strengths. This means that they use a more variable coding system.

So in simpler terms, scientists used to think that neurons in the brain only send very strong or no signals, like a light switch. But now they have discovered that neurons in the outer layer of our brain use a more flexible system, where the signals can vary in strength.
