> (i)         A term used to indicate that a particular skill or ability has been gained by an animal or human being. When applied to language, the term acquisition is used to avoid drawing inferences about whether language has been learned or inherited. Stating that a skill has been acquired implies that the actual process by which the skill was obtained is not the issue being discussed at that particular time.(ii)        The phase during a conditioning procedure in which the response is learned or strengthened. See learning.

## What is the definition of acquisition according to Psychologists?

acquisition is (i)         A term used to indicate that a particular skill or ability has been gained by an animal or human being. When applied to language, the term acquisition is used to avoid drawing inferences about whether language has been learned or inherited. Stating that a skill has been acquired implies that the actual process by which the skill was obtained is not the issue being discussed at that particular time.(ii)        The phase during a conditioning procedure in which the response is learned or strengthened. See learning.

(i) Acquisition means that someone or something has gained a certain skill or ability. When we talk about language, we use the word 'acquisition' to avoid saying if the language has been learned or passed down from parents. Saying that a skill has been acquired means we're not talking about how the skill was learned right now.

(ii) Conditioning is a process where someone learns or gets better at a certain response. During this process, there is a phase called acquisition where the response is learned or made stronger. This is also called learning.

 

## What are the example case of acquisition?

One of the most important and well-known studies in the field of acquisition is Noam Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar. Chomsky proposed that all humans are born with an innate ability to acquire language, and that there is a universal set of grammatical principles and structures common to all languages.

Another significant study is the work conducted by B.F. Skinner on Operant Conditioning, particularly his research with language acquisition in children. Skinner argued that language is acquired through a process of reinforcement and conditioning, and that children learn through positive reinforcement of correct language production.

A notable contribution to the understanding of language acquisition is the study by Jean Piaget, who proposed a theory of cognitive development. Piaget suggested that children progress through distinct stages of development, and that language acquisition is closely tied to the cognitive abilities and schemas developed during these stages.

In recent years, there has been a growing body of research on the role of input in language acquisition. Studies have shown that the quantity and quality of linguistic input, such as exposure to rich and varied language experiences, play a crucial role in children's language development.

Furthermore, research by Elizabeth Bates and Brian MacWhinney has focused on the process of morphological acquisition, specifically looking at how children acquire the grammatical rules and inflectional patterns of their native language.

These are just a few notable examples, but there is a vast and diverse range of research on language acquisition from various perspectives including cognitive, psychological, and computational approaches.
