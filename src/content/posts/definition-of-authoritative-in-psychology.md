> A term used by Baumrind to describe a style of parenting or a child-rearing style in which children are encouraged to participate in decisionmaking and to express their opinions, but the parent nonetheless has the final authority. This was in contrast with an autocratic approach, in which the child is not encouraged to express an opinion; or a laissez-faire approach, in which the parent has little involvement in the process of decision-making. The model has also been applied to leadership styles. See also authoritarian personality.

## What is the definition of authoritative according to Psychologists?

authoritative is A term used by Baumrind to describe a style of parenting or a child-rearing style in which children are encouraged to participate in decisionmaking and to express their opinions, but the parent nonetheless has the final authority. This was in contrast with an autocratic approach, in which the child is not encouraged to express an opinion; or a laissez-faire approach, in which the parent has little involvement in the process of decision-making. The model has also been applied to leadership styles. See also authoritarian personality.

Baumrind made up a word to describe a certain way parents take care of their kids. In this style, parents encourage their kids to be a part of decisions and share their thoughts, but the parents still have the final say. This is different from another way of parenting where kids aren't allowed to speak up, or from another way where parents don't get involved much in making decisions. This way of parenting can also be used to describe how some leaders lead.
