> The amount of information that a communication channel can carry. For example, the amount of information that the copper wire of a phone line can carry is its bandwidth. The term is used about actual communication channels both in electronics and in the nervous system (for example, in the optic nerve) and also about hypothetical channels in models of information processing.

## What is the definition of bandwidth according to Psychologists?

bandwidth is The amount of information that a communication channel can carry. For example, the amount of information that the copper wire of a phone line can carry is its bandwidth. The term is used about actual communication channels both in electronics and in the nervous system (for example, in the optic nerve) and also about hypothetical channels in models of information processing.

Bandwidth refers to the capacity or amount of information that can be carried by a communication channel, like a phone line. It is like the maximum number of cars that can travel on a road at one time. The term is used in both electronics (like copper wires) and in the nervous system (like the optic nerve in our eyes). It can also be used to talk about theoretical or hypothetical channels in models of information processing. Basically, it's all about how much information can be transmitted in a certain channel.
