> The elongated stem of a neurone, by means of which the electrical impulse is passed from one region of the nervous system to another. The axon is that part of the neurone found after the cell body, according to the direction of travel of the impulse. In afferent or sensory neurones, the elongated part of the neurone found before the cell body is known as the dendron.

## What is the definition of axon according to Psychologists?

axon is The elongated stem of a neurone, by means of which the electrical impulse is passed from one region of the nervous system to another. The axon is that part of the neurone found after the cell body, according to the direction of travel of the impulse. In afferent or sensory neurones, the elongated part of the neurone found before the cell body is known as the dendron.

The axon is like a long stem that helps pass messages from one part of the nervous system to another. It is found after the main part of the nerve cell, called the cell body. The axon carries electrical signals in a specific direction. In some types of nerve cells, there is another long part called the dendron, which is found before the cell body. Both the axon and dendron help transmit messages in different ways.
