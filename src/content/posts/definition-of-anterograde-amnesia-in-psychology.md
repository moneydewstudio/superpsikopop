## What is the definition of anterograde amnesia according to Psychologists?

anterograde amnesia is A form of amnesia (i.e. loss of memory) in which the person becomes unable to store new information, although memories that were laid down before the amnesia-producing event remain intact and accessible. See also retrograde amnesia, amnesia.

There is a type of memory loss called amnesia where someone can't remember new things. However, they can still remember old things from before they got amnesia. It's like having a file cabinet where the new files keep getting lost, but the old files are still there and can be found.

 

## What are the example case of anterograde amnesia?

1\. "The nature and mechanism of anterograde amnesia: Insights from neuroimaging studies" - This research explores the neural basis of anterograde amnesia by using various neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate brain activity patterns in individuals with the condition.

2\. "Understanding anterograde amnesia through experimental studies" - This research focuses on conducting experimental studies to examine the cognitive processes and mechanisms underlying anterograde amnesia. This may involve studying memory consolidation, attentional processes, and other related cognitive functions to better understand the condition.

3\. "Memory training interventions for individuals with anterograde amnesia" - This research examines the efficacy of different memory training interventions in individuals with anterograde amnesia. It aims to develop and test strategies that can assist these individuals in improving their memory function and daily life activities.

4\. "Effects of pharmacological interventions on anterograde amnesia" - This research investigates the potential use of drugs and pharmacological interventions to alleviate or treat anterograde amnesia. It explores the impact of different medications on memory consolidation and retrieval processes in individuals with the condition.

5\. "Role of the hippocampus in anterograde amnesia" - This research focuses on understanding the specific role of the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory formation, in the development of anterograde amnesia. It may involve studying patients with hippocampal damage or employing animal models to examine the neural mechanisms underlying memory impairment.

6\. "Neuropsychological assessments and rehabilitation strategies for anterograde amnesia" - This research aims to develop comprehensive neuropsychological assessment tools and rehabilitation strategies specifically tailored for individuals with anterograde amnesia. It explores different approaches, such as cognitive rehabilitation or compensatory memory strategies, to enhance their daily functioning and quality of life.

7\. "Relationship between anterograde amnesia and other cognitive deficits" - This research explores the relationship between anterograde amnesia and other cognitive impairments such as executive dysfunction, attention deficits, or retrograde amnesia. It aims to understand how these deficits interact and impact overall cognitive functioning in individuals with anterograde amnesia.

It is important to note that these are general areas of research and not specific studies. Actual research studies and their findings within each of these areas can vary.

 

## What are other terms related to anterograde amnesia?

1\. Retrograde amnesia: Retrograde amnesia refers to the inability to recall memories or events that occurred before the onset of amnesia. It is the opposite of anterograde amnesia.

2\. Global transient amnesia: Global transient amnesia is a temporary form of anterograde amnesia characterized by a sudden, complete loss of the ability to form new memories. It usually lasts for several hours.

3\. Post-traumatic amnesia: Post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) is a form of anterograde amnesia that occurs after a traumatic brain injury. It refers to the period of time following the injury during which the person experiences memory loss for events and information encountered after the injury.

4\. Dissociative amnesia: Dissociative amnesia is a psychological disorder characterized by memory loss that is not attributable to physiological factors. It involves the sudden inability to recall important personal information, often due to stress or trauma.

5\. Korsakoff's syndrome: Korsakoff's syndrome is a chronic neurological disorder caused by severe deficiency of thiamine (Vitamin B1) due to alcohol abuse or malnutrition. It is characterized by anterograde amnesia, confabulation (fabrication of false memories), and other cognitive impairments.

6\. Transient global amnesia: Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a temporary episode of memory loss that typically lasts for several hours. It is characterized by sudden-onset anterograde amnesia, confusion, and repetitive questioning about recent events.

7\. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a combined condition of Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's syndrome. Wernicke's encephalopathy is an acute neurological disorder caused by thiamine deficiency, resulting in confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. If untreated, it can progress to Korsakoff's syndrome, which involves long-term memory impairments and confabulation.

8\. Transient epileptic amnesia: Transient epileptic amnesia (TEA) is a condition where brief episodes of amnesia occur during or after a seizure. It is characterized by the sudden inability to recall recent events or form new memories.

These terms are all related to different aspects of anterograde amnesia and provide a broader understanding of memory impairment and related conditions.
