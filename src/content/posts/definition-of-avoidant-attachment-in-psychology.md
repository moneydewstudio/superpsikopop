## What is the definition of avoidant attachment according to Psychologists?

avoidant attachment is A relationship style in which the infant (or adult) avoids close emotional contact with the parent (or partner). See insecure attachment.

A relationship style is like the way people act and feel when they are with someone they care about, like a parent or a partner. "Infant" means a baby, and "adult" means a grown-up. So, this is talking about how babies or grown-ups act when they don't want to be emotionally close to their parent, or when they don't want to be close to their partner.

Sometimes, when people have an insecure attachment, it means they are not comfortable being really close or sharing their emotions with someone they care about. They might want to be more distant and not let the other person get too close.
