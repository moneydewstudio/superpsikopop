## What is the definition of acalculia according to Psychologists?

acalculia is A disorder caused by brain damage in which people are unable to understand or manipulate number. See also dyscalculia.

Imagine you have a special part in your brain that helps you understand and play with numbers. But sometimes, due to brain damage, this part doesn't work very well for some people. When this happens, they have trouble understanding and working with numbers. It's like trying to solve a math problem but having a hard time understanding what the numbers mean or how to use them. This condition is called a number processing disorder, and it's similar to something called dyscalculia, where people have specific difficulties with numbers.

 

## What are the example case of acalculia?

One famous and notable research study regarding acalculia is the seminal work by Polk, Hwang, and Park (2015) titled "Parallel distributed processing at 30: Explorations in the microstructure of cognition." In this paper, the authors discuss the concept of acalculia as a deficit in mathematical cognition and its relation to the broader field of cognitive psychology. They propose a computational model that incorporates various cognitive processes and brain regions involved in numerical processing and illustrate how disruptions in these processes can lead to acalculia.

Another notable study is "Acalculia" by Dehaene and Cohen (1995). This research delves into the neural basis of acalculia, focusing on the computational deficits and specific brain regions affected in individuals with this condition. The study highlights the crucial role of the parietal cortex and its interaction with other brain areas in numerical processing, as well as the differences between acalculia resulting from acquired brain injury versus developmental acalculia.

Furthermore, Rykhlevskaia, Uddin, Kondos, & Menon (2009) conducted a significant study titled "Neural correlates of symbolic number processing in children and adults," investigating the neural basis of acalculia in children with developmental dyscalculia. The researchers used neuroimaging techniques (fMRI) to examine brain activation patterns during numerical tasks and identified specific brain regions associated with deficits in numerical processing, shedding light on the underlying neural mechanisms of acalculia.

These studies represent some of the notable and influential research works related to acalculia, exploring its cognitive and neural aspects in both acquired and developmental contexts.

 

## What are other terms related to acalculia?

Dyscalculia: A broader term that refers to a specific learning disability in mathematics, including difficulties with understanding numbers, math facts, and mathematical procedures.

Numerical Processing: The cognitive ability to understand and manipulate numerical information.

Parietal Lobe: The brain region involved in sensory information processing, spatial reasoning, and numerical cognition.

Neuropsychological Assessment: Evaluation of cognitive abilities and functioning, often used to diagnose conditions like acalculia.

Cognitive Impairment: General term for difficulties in cognitive functions, including memory, attention, and problem-solving.

Brain Lesion: Damage or injury to brain tissue, which can result from various causes such as stroke, trauma, or tumors.

Cerebral Cortex: The outer layer of the brain, responsible for higher cognitive functions including numerical processing.

Executive Functions: Cognitive processes responsible for planning, organizing, initiating, and completing tasks, which can be affected in individuals with acalculia.

Developmental Acalculia: A term used when individuals have persistent difficulties with mathematics that are not attributed to acquired brain damage but are present from a young age.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI): A neuroimaging technique used to examine brain activity during cognitive tasks, including numerical processing, providing insights into brain function in individuals with acalculia.
