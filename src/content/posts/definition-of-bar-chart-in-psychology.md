## What is the definition of bar chart according to Psychologists?

bar chart is A statistical diagram in which the frequency, or amount, of two or more discrete variables is indicated by the length of a bar for each one. A histogram is a particularly accurate form of bar chart.

A histogram is a special kind of chart that helps us show information about different categories or groups. It's kind of like a bar chart, but it's used when we want to compare how often something happens in different groups.

In a histogram, we use bars to represent each group, and the length of the bar tells us how many times something happens in that group. So, if a bar is longer, it means that something happens more often in that group compared to a group with a shorter bar.

The cool thing about histograms is that they give us a really accurate picture of how things are spread out among different groups.
