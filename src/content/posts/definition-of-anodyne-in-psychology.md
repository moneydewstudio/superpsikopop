## What is the definition of anodyne according to Psychologists?

anodyne is A pain-relieving treatment or agent.

A pain-relieving treatment or agent is something that helps you feel better when you're in pain. It could be a medicine that you take, like a pill or a cream that you put on your skin. When you have a pain like a headache or a sore muscle, this treatment can help make the pain go away or feel less intense. It's like a special helper that takes away your pain so you can feel more comfortable.
