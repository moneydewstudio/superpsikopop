> (19252021) Bandura is, in an understated way, one of the most influential figures of twentieth-century psychology. He has been a major figure in the social cognitive aspects of psychology, in one form or another, for over 50 years. This includes a lengthy period in which social aspects of cognition were only accepted as a result of his experimental demonstrations of modellingand imitation, which ensured that, even during the behaviourist heyday, there was some recognition that not all learning consisted exclusively of stimulus response connections and conditioning. In later years, Bandura developed an interest in personal agency and self-directedness, and contributed greatly to the psychological understanding of self-efficacy beliefs.

## What is the definition of Bandura, Albert according to Psychologists?

Bandura, Albert is (19252021) Bandura is, in an understated way, one of the most influential figures of twentieth-century psychology. He has been a major figure in the social cognitive aspects of psychology, in one form or another, for over 50 years. This includes a lengthy period in which social aspects of cognition were only accepted as a result of his experimental demonstrations of modellingand imitation, which ensured that, even during the behaviourist heyday, there was some recognition that not all learning consisted exclusively of stimulus response connections and conditioning. In later years, Bandura developed an interest in personal agency and self-directedness, and contributed greatly to the psychological understanding of self-efficacy beliefs.

Bandura, a psychologist who lived from 1925 to 2021, was a very important person in the field of psychology during the 20th century. He focused on how people learn from observing others and imitating their behavior. He showed through his experiments that learning does not always happen just by responding to things in our environment. This was a big deal because at that time, most people believed that learning was only about reacting to our surroundings. Bandura's work helped people realize that there is more to learning than just that.

Later on, Bandura became interested in how people believe in themselves and their abilities. He studied something called "self-efficacy beliefs," which are our beliefs about what we can do and how well we can do it. He made important contributions to our understanding of these beliefs.

 

## What are the example case of Bandura, Albert?

1) Bandura, A. (1961). Identification as a process of incidental learning. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 63(3), 311-318. - This study examined the process of identification by showing that individuals can acquire new behaviors through observing and imitating others. Bandura demonstrated that learning can occur not only through direct reinforcement but also through observational learning.

2) Bandura, A., Ross, D., & Ross, S.A. (1961). Transmission of aggression through imitation of aggressive models. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 63(3), 575-582. - This classic study investigated the transmission of aggression through observational learning. Bandura showed that children who observed aggressive behavior from adult models were more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior themselves. This research demonstrated the social learning theory and highlighted the importance of vicarious learning.

3) Bandura, A., & Walters, R.H. (1963). Social learning and personality development. Holt, Rinehart, & Winston. - This book is a comprehensive overview of Bandura's social learning theory. It explores how individuals acquire behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes through observational learning. Bandura argues that personality development is shaped not only by direct reinforcement but also by modeling and cognitive processes.

4) Bandura, A., & Mischel, W. (1965). Modification of self-impulsiveness through exposure to live and symbolic models. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2(5), 679-688. - This study examined how self-impulsiveness can be modified through exposure to models. Bandura and Mischel found that individuals who observed models successfully controlling their impulses were more likely to exhibit similar self-control. This research supports Bandura's idea that behavior can be learned through observation and modeling.

5) Bandura, A. (1977). Social learning theory. Prentice-Hall. - This influential book provides an in-depth explanation of Bandura's social learning theory. Bandura discusses various factors that influence behavior, including reinforcement, observational learning, modeling, and self-efficacy. He presents numerous studies and real-life examples to support his theory.

6) Bandura, A. (1986). Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory. Prentice-Hall. - In this book, Bandura expands his social learning theory into social cognitive theory. He emphasizes the role of cognitive processes, self-regulation, and self-efficacy in human behavior. Bandura presents a comprehensive framework for understanding social learning and its application in various domains, including education, health, and personality development.

 

## What are other terms related to Bandura, Albert?

1\. Social Learning Theory: Bandura's theory that emphasizes the importance of observational learning and the impact of social influences on behavior.

2\. Observational Learning: The process of acquiring new behaviors or knowledge by observing and imitating others.

3\. Self-efficacy: Bandura's concept referring to an individual's belief in their ability to successfully perform specific tasks or achieve goals.

4\. Reciprocal Determinism: Bandura's idea that behavior is influenced by the interaction between personal factors (such as beliefs and goals), environmental factors, and behavior itself.

5\. Vicarious Reinforcement: The process of learning through observing the consequences of others' behavior, as opposed to experiencing the consequences directly.

6\. Modeling: The act of imitating or replicating the behaviors, attitudes, or traits of someone else, particularly those observed as influential or successful.

7\. Prosocial Behavior: Behaviors that are beneficial to others or society as a whole, often influenced by observing positive role models or being reinforced for prosocial acts.

8\. Self-regulation: The ability to monitor and control one's own thoughts, behaviors, and emotions, often in order to achieve goals or adhere to personal standards.

9\. Social Cognitive Theory: A broader theoretical approach that encompasses Bandura's ideas on social learning, emphasizing the role of cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, and motivation, in shaping behavior.

10\. Behaviorism: A psychological approach that focuses on the study of observable behavior and the role of environmental stimuli and reinforcement in shaping behavior. Bandura's work incorporates elements of behaviorism while also highlighting the importance of cognitive processes.
