## What is the definition of aversion therapy according to Psychologists?

aversion therapy is A technique of behaviour therapy that involves using classical conditioning to develop alternative behaviour patterns in the individual. It is achieved by the association of unpleasant stimuli or consequences with the maladaptive behaviour, such that the behaviour comes to be avoided. See also antabuse.

In behavior therapy, there is a technique called "aversive conditioning" that helps people develop better habits. This technique uses a special way of teaching, where they link a bad habit with something unpleasant, like a bad feeling or consequence. This makes the person want to avoid the bad habit. It's similar to a medicine called Antabuse that helps people who want to stop drinking alcohol.
