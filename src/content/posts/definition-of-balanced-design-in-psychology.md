## What is the definition of balanced design according to Psychologists?

balanced design is An experimental design in which sources of variation such as practice, fatigue or gender of subjects are balanced so that they will not be responsible for differences between groups. See ABBA design.

A balanced experimental design is a way of setting up a scientific study to make sure that different factors, like practice or being tired, don't affect the results. We want to be able to compare two groups and make sure any differences we see are because of what we're testing, not because of other things. One way to do this is by using something called an ABBA design, which helps keep everything fair and balanced. This helps scientists make sure that any differences they find between the groups they're studying are truly because of what they're testing and not because of other things that might be going on.
