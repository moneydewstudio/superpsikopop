## What is the definition of action disorganisation syndrome according to Psychologists?

action disorganisation syndrome is See frontal apraxia.

Frontal apraxia is a condition that affects a part of our brain called the frontal lobe, and can make it difficult for a person to plan and carry out their movements properly. It's like when you have trouble making your body do what you want it to do, even though you know how to do it. For example, imagine if you wanted to pick up a pencil, but your hand wouldn't do it the right way or it wouldn't move at all. That's what it can be like for someone with frontal apraxia. It happens because the front part of the brain, which helps with coordination, is not working correctly.
