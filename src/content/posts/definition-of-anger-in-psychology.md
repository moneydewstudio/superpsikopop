> An emotion based on a high state of arousal, often generated when someone else is judged to have violated a social norm of some kind. Anger is usually a transient emotion, often confused with aggression although very different. Partly because of this confusion and partly because of its transience, there is relatively little direct research into anger, but it has been shown that it activates areas in the ventromedial cortex and in the orbitofrontal cortex, and that its strength is directly affected by adrenaline levels in the body. Researchers have also found that regulation and modification of the expression of anger involves input from the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex.

## What is the definition of anger according to Psychologists?

anger is An emotion based on a high state of arousal, often generated when someone else is judged to have violated a social norm of some kind. Anger is usually a transient emotion, often confused with aggression although very different. Partly because of this confusion and partly because of its transience, there is relatively little direct research into anger, but it has been shown that it activates areas in the ventromedial cortex and in the orbitofrontal cortex, and that its strength is directly affected by adrenaline levels in the body. Researchers have also found that regulation and modification of the expression of anger involves input from the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex.

Anger is a feeling that happens when you get really worked up about something, like when someone does something you think is really not okay. It's a strong feeling, but it usually doesn't last for a long time. Sometimes people mix up anger with aggression, but they are actually different. Anger can make certain parts of your brain become active, like the ventromedial cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Also, the strength of your anger can be influenced by the levels of adrenaline in your body, which is a chemical that can make you feel more excited or pumped up. Scientists have also discovered that controlling and changing how you show your anger involves other parts of your brain called the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex.
