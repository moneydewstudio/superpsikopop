## What is the definition of assumption according to Psychologists?

assumption is An idea or set of ideas that is taken for granted in the formulation of an argument or theory. If made explicit, it is sometimes called an axiom.

An assumption is like a piece of information that people automatically believe to be true when they are trying to prove or explain something. It's like an important rule that everyone agrees to follow. When assumptions are clearly stated, they are sometimes called axioms.
